THIS WAS ON THE HUGOTON LINE ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE ARKANSAS RIVER AT HUTCHINSON, KANSAS.  JOHN DUMOND RESPONDED TO THE ONE CALL (TICKET #204363).  JOHN DUMOND MET JOHN KEENER WITH BRB CONTRACTORS OF TOPEKA, KS.  JOHN DUMOND SPOTTED ALL THREE OF OUR LINES WHICH ALL RAN AT A DEPTH OF 63"" TO 66"".  THE LINES WERE FLAGGED WITH YELLOW FLAGS THAT HAVE OUR NAME AND PHONE NUMBER ON THEM.  JOHN DUMOND WROTE THE DEPTH OF EACH LINE ON THE FLAGS AT EACH LOCATION WHERE HE SPOTTED THE LINES WITH A LINE FINDER AND PROBED EACH LOCATION WITH A SPOTTING BAR.  BRB IS THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR FOR KANSAS GAS SERVICE WHICH IS A DIVISION ON ONOEK.  A&L UNDERGROUND IS A SUB-CONTRACTOR OF BRB CONTRACTORS INC DOING THE DIRECTIONAL BORE OF THE ARKANSAS RIVER.  A&L UNDERGROUND AND BRB WERE ASKED TO EXPOSE OUR LINES TO THE BOTTOM OF EACH LINE WHERE WE COULD SEE THE DRILL STEM AND BITS WERE WELL BELOW OUR LINE. THEY SAID THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO DO THIS BECAUSE THEY WOULD LOSE THE CIRCULATION OF THEIR DRILLING MUD.  THE DRILL STEM WORE A HOLE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE SOUTH 20"" RIVER CROSSING. BILL WHITEHEAD WAS CALLED AT 4:10 AM SUNDAY MORNING JUNE 23, 2002, BY JOHN DUMOND, BILL CALLED OPERATIONS CONTROL ON HIS WAY TO THE LOCATION. A & L UNDERGROUND HAD CALLED JOHN.  JOHN DUMOND HAD BEEN WITH BOTH CONTRACTORS WHEN THEY STARTED TO BORE THE RIVER CROSSING, AND REPEATEDLY ASSURED JOHN DUMOND THAT THEY WERE 10' BELOW OUR LINE.  WHEN JOHN DUMOND AND BILL WHITEHEAD GOT TO THE SITE, THE BORING CREW HAD MOVED AWAY FROM THE BORING RIG AND WERE WAITING FOR THEM.  JOHN AND BILL GOT THERE ALONG WITH KANSAS GAS SERVICE.  OPERATIONS CONTROL WAS NOT SEEING ANY LOSS OF PRESSURE.  AFTER THEY DETERMINED THAT IT WAS OUR LINE, THEY STARTED SHUTTING IT IN.  DAN JASO AND MIKE HUGGANS WERE CALLED OUT TO HELP OPERATE THE GATES TO SHUT THE LINE SEGMENT IN.  THE LINE HAD 740 PSIG ON IT AT THE TIME.  THERE WAS NO FIRE, INJURIES, EMERGENCY PERSONNEL OR MEDIA INVOLVED WITH THE INCIDENT.  THE LINE WAS ALLOWED TO BLOW DOWN THROUGH THE DAMAGED SPOT BECAUSE OF THE GROUND WATER THAT SHOWED UP WHEN THEY STARTED DIGGING THE LINE OUT TO INSPECT IT.  BRB AND KANSAS AND KANSAS GAS SERVICE BROUGHT IN TRACK MOUNTED BACKHOES TO DIG THE DAMAGED LINE OUT.  GROUND WATER BECAME A MAJOR PROBLEM WHILE EXPOSING THE DAMAGED LINE.  BRB BROUGHT IN A 6"" & 8"" DITCH PUMPS WHICH ALLOWED US TO SEE THE LINE WITH THE DRILL STEM UNDER IT.  WE WERE NOT ABLE TO INSTALL A CLAMP ON THE LINE UNTIL ABOUT MIDNIGHT SUNDAY NIGHT JUNE 23, 2002.  A & L UNDERGROUND GOT THE DRILL STEM AND REAMER AWAY FROM OUR LINE AND WILLIAMS EMPLOYEES WERE ABLE TO INSTALL TWO BANDS CLAMPS TO KEEP THE WATER OUT OF THE LINE.  WE KEPT ABOUT 10-20 PSIG ON THE LINE BECAUSE OF THE WATER UNTIL THE LINE WAS READY TO REPAIR. BRB WAS HANDLING THE EXCAVATING OF THE DAMAGED LINE AND PUMPING THE WATER ALONG WITH INSTALLATION OF SAND POINTS TO DRY THE HOLE UP ENOUGH SO WE COULD MAKE THE REPAIR.

ON AUGUST 20 THE NAUTILUS- OPERATIONS TECHNICIAN NOTICED GAS SEEPING FROM THE BASE OF A 2"" WELD-O-LET IN NAUTILUS GARDEN CITY MANIFOLD ON THE 24"" PIPING TO THE EXXON GAS PLANT. THE GAS FLOW TO EXXON WAS IMMEDIATELY SHUTDOWN. THE AFFECTED PIPING WAS ISOLATED (DOUBLE-BLOCKED IN BY CLOSING TWO UPSTREAM VALVES AND TWO DOWNSTREAM VALVES) AND THE AFFECTED LINE SECTION (APPROXIMATELY 60 FOOT LINE) WAS BLOWN DOWN. GAS DELIVERY TO THE ADJACENT NEPTUNE PLANT WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE SAFELY. NO PUBLIC OR ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE WAS CAUSED BY THIS INCIDENT. THE 2"" WELD-O-LET WAS LOCATED IN THE NAUTILUS MANIFOLD DOWNSTREAM OF THE EXXON ORIFICE METERS AND IMMEDIATELY UPSTREAM OF THE EXXON CONTROL VALVE (FV 3030). THE 2"" WELD-O-LET WAS USED FOR A SAMPLE POINT AND WAS ONE OF THREE 2"" WELD-O-LETS ON A 4 FT. LONG 24 IN DIAMETER JOINT OF PIPE. WET MAGNETIC PARTICLE TESTING CONFIRMED THAT THERE IS A CRACK IN THE PARENT PIPE EXTENDING ABOUT 2"" ALONG THE PIPE AXIS TO EITHER SIDE OF THE FILLET WELD. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE CRACK IS UNDETERMINED AT THIS TIME. THE SPECIMEN CONTAINING THE CRACK HAS BEEN SENT TO KIEFNER & ASSOCIATES IN COLUMBUS, OHIO FOR FAILURE ANALYSIS. AT THE TIME OF THE RELEASE, IT WAS BELIEVED THAT REPAIR COSTS WOULD BE LESS THAN $50,000. A DETERMINATION WAS MADE ON AUGUST 23, 2002 THAT REPAIR COSTS WOULD EXCEED $50,000 AND THE NRC WAS NOTIFIED.   4-18-03 LABORATORY ANALYSIS OF THE FAILED SPECIMEN INDICATED THAT THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO FATIGUE CRACKING FROM VIBRATION LOADINGS.  THE CRACK INITIATED AT TOE OF FILLET WELD AT A SHARP CORNER BETWEEN THE FIRST PASS OF THE WELDMENT AND THE CARRIER PIPE BODY.  KIEFNER AND ASSOCIATES WAS CONSULTED CONCERNING THE CAUSE CLASSIFICATION OF THIS EVENT."

THE CONTRACTOR WAS MADE AWARE OF THE GAS PIPELINE LOCATION BY A VENOCO EMPLOYEE PERFORMING ROUTINE PIPELINE SYSTEM MONITORING. THE GAS PIPELINE LOCATION WAS DESCRIBED AND IDENTIFIED BY THE VENOCO EMPLOYEE TO THE CONTRACTRO SUPERVISOR ON SITE. PERMANENT PIPELINE MARKERS WERE IN PLACE IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA AND WERE POINTED OUT AS WELL AS A PIPELINE DESCRIPTION PROVIDED TO THE CONTRACTOR SUPERVISOR. FOLLOWING THE ABOVE EVENTS, THE CONTRACTOR BUILT A STAGING AREA DIRECTLY ABOVE THE VENOCO GAS PIPELINE FOR SLURRY MIXING OPERATIONS TO SUPPORT THE WATER PIPELINE PROJECT. THIS STAGING AREA WAS AWAY FROM THE TRENCHINGAND EXCAVATING ACTIVITIES DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH LAYING THE WATER PIPELINE.

AT THAT TIME VENOCO'S CONTRACTOR TALKED WITH THE WATER PIPELINE PROJECT SUPERVISOR ON-SITE REGARDING THE LOCATION OF THE GAS PIPELINE INCLUDING THE PIPELINE LOCATION WITHIN THE WATER PROJECT STAGING AREA. A MATERIAL PILE EXISTED IN THE STAGING AREA TO SUPPORT A PUG MIXER AND SLURRY OPERATIONS. THE MATERIAL PILE WAS LOCATED DIRECTLY ABOVE THE GAS PIPELINE. A FRONT END LOADER WAS BEING USED TO MOVE MATERIAL FROM THE PILE TO THE PUG MIXER. OVER A PERIOD OF TIME, WHILE MOVING MATERIAL TO THE PUG MIXER THE FRONT END LOADER WAS ALSO REMOVING ADDITIONAL EARTH ABOVE THE PIPELINE. EVENTUALLY, WHILE SCRAPING  THE GROUND MOVING INTO THE MATERIAL PILE FOR ANOTHER LOAD THE FRONT END LOADER BUCKET TORE A 4"" X 6"" HOLE IN THE GAS PIPELINE. THE PIPELINE AUTOMATICALLY ISOLATED ON LOW PRESSURE. THE WORKER EVACUATED THE AREA, THE AREA WAS SECURED AND ISOLATED BY THE CONTRACTOR UNTIL VENOCO RESPONDERS ARRIVED.

MS. NICOLE HOTZFIELD WAS DRIVING HER FORD RANGER PICKUP WHEN IT LEFT A RURAL TOWNSHIP ROAD STRIKING AN EIGHT-INCH VALVE SITE ON GREAT PLAINS NATURAL GAS CO.'S (GPNG'S) TRANSMISSION PIPELINE NEAR PELICAN RAPIDS, MN. THIS VALVE SITE IS THE TAKE-OFF POINT FOR A THREE-INCH DIAMETER TRANSMISSION PIPELINE THAT SERVES PELICAN RAPIDS. AFTER THE ACCIDENT, THE DRIVER CALLED FOR 911 EMERGENCY SERVICES, AND THEN LEFT THE SCENE OF HER OWN ACCORD. EMERGENCY RESPONDERS CLOSED THE COUNTY ROAD WHILE GPNG EMPLOYEES DETERMINED THE BEST METHOD TO STOP THE RELEASE OF GAS WITHOUT UNNECESSARILY ENDANGERING ANYONE. AROUND NOON ON OCTOBER 20, THE PRESSURE ON THE LINE HAD BEEN LOWERED TO APPROXIMATELY 350 PSIG AND TWO-EMPLOYEES IN PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT USED AN ""EASYOUT"" TO REMOVE A BROKEN 1/4"" DIAMETER NIPPLE FROM WHERE A PRESSURE TAP WAS BROKEN AS A RESULT OF THE ACCIDENT. A NEW NIPPLE WAS THREADED IN A VALVE IN THE OPEN POSITION INSTALLED. FINALLY, THE VALVE WAS CLOSED, STOPPING THE UNCONTROLLED RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS. AT THIS POINT IT WAS UNCLEAR THAT THE DAMAGES WOULD EXCEED $50,000 AND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT THERE WERE INJURIES REQUIRING I-PATIENT CARE. ACCORDINGLY, THE INCIDENT WAS NOT REPORTED TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER. MINNESOTA OFFICE OF PIPELINE SAFETY OFFICER SWEENEY WAS KEPT INFORMED THROUGHOUT THE EVENT. ON MONDAY, OCTOBER 21,2002,A TEAM ASSESSED THE DAMAGE AND DEVELOPED A COURSE OF ACTION TO REPLACE THE DAMAGED THREE-INCH PIPING THAT SERVES PELICAN RAPIDS AND TO MAKE THE REMAINDER OF THE VALVE SITE SAFE UNTIL THE NEXT WARM SEASON WHEN THE LINE CAN BE REMOVED FROM SERVICE WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING SERVICE TO THOUSAND OF CUSTOMERS. AT THIS TIME AN ESTIMATE WAS MADE FOR THE REPAIRS. THE TEMPORARY REPAIRS WOULD COST APPROXIMATELY $20,000 AND THE PERMANENT REPAIRS, APPROXIMATELY $40,000. THE HIGH COST IS DUE TO THE NEED FOR STOPPER FITTING AND TEMPORARY BYPASS PIPING WHILE REPAIRS ARE MADE. BASED ON THIS INFORMATION, GPNG IMMEDIATELY FIELD AN INCIDENT REPORT WITH THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER, 1730 HOURS, OCTORBER 21, 2002. ON THURSDAY, OCTOBER 24, 2002 AT APPROXIMATELY 9:30 P.M CDT, TEMPORARY REPAIRS TO THE PIPING WERE COMPLETED. GPNG WILL COMPLETE FINAL REPAIRS IN THE SPRING OF 2003."

WILLIAMSON THREAD - O RING FITTING.  INITIAL INVESTIGATION IDENTIFIED THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK AS A POSSIBLE FAILED GASKET THAT COULD BE REPAIRED BY PLUGGING THE TAP USING A T.D. WILLIAMSON TOOL, REMOVING THE VALVE AND FLANGE, AND INSTALLING A CAP ON THE 2"" NIPPLE.  SINCE IT WAS LATE IN THE DAY AND THE LEAK WAS SMALL AND DID NOT POSE AN IMMEDIATE OR PROBABLE HAZARD TO THE PUBLIC, IT WAS DECIDED TO SECURE THE WORK SITE AND WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT DAY TO COMPLETE THE WORK.  UPON RETURNING TO THE SITE AND WITH FURTHER INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE THREADED NIPPLE TO FLANGE JOINT WAS ACTUALLY LEAKING BUT THAT THE REPAIR COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED USING THE SAME PROCEDURE AS ORIGINALLY PLANNED TO STOP THE LEAK.  WHILE ATTEMPTING TO REMOVE THE DE-PRESSURZIED PIPING DOWNSTREAM OF THE TAP VALVE TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE VALVE FOR ATTACHMENT OF THE T.D. WILLIAMSON TOOL, A SLIGHT MOVEMENT OF THE PIPE CAUSED THE LEAK CHARACTERISTICS TO CHANGE (SOUND OF ESCAPING GAS INCREASED).  UPON RE-EVALUATION IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE THREADS OF THE NIPPLE OR FLANGE MAY BE DAMAGED AND THAT IT WOULD BE UNSAFE FOR THE EMPLOYEES TO PROCEED WITH THE INITIAL REPAIR APPROACH.  AT 12:30 PM JANUARY 10, 2003 A DECISION WAS MADE TO LOWER THE LINE PRESSURE TO ZERO BEFORE ATTEMPTING ANY FURTHER REPAIR THE LEAK.  THE COST OF THE GAS LOST DURING THE BLOW DOWN OF THE PIPELINE WOULD MAKE THE REPAIR COST EXCEED $50,000 CLASSIFYING THE LEAK AS AN INCIDENT.  AN INCIDENT REPORT WAS FILED WITH THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AT 1:14 PM JANUARY 10, 2003. SINCE THIS LINE PROVIDES SUPPLIES TO LOCAL DISTRIBUTIONS COMPANIES, ALTERNATE GAS SUPPLIES NEEDED TO BE ARRANGED BEFORE REPAIRS COULD BEGIN.  THEREFORE, AS AN ADDITIONAL SAFETY MEASURE, A REQUEST TO GAS CONTROL TO LOWER PRESSURE TO <450PSIG AND NOT TO ALLOW FLUCTUATION WAS MADE AT 7:00 PM FRIDAY, JANUARY 10, 2003 AND THE SITE WAS ALSO BARRICADED AND TAPED OFF WITH WARNING TAPE.  STABILITY OF 440 PSIG WAS ACCOMPLISHED AT 2:00 AM SATURDAY, JANUARY 11, 2003.  THE LEAK AT THIS POINT WAS LIMITED TO APPROXIMATELY 1MCF/HR.  AT 9:00 AM SUNDAY, JANUARY 12, 2003 ALTERNATE GAS FEEDS TO LOCAL DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES WERE INITIATED AND NOTIFICATIONS WERE ALSO MADE TO LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL AUTHORITIES AS WELL AS AFFECTED GULF SOUTH CUSTOMERS.  AT 12:15 PM SUNDAY, JANUARY 12, 2003 THE PRESSURE IN THE PIPELINE WAS 313 PSIG AND THE BLOW DOWN OF THE PIPELINE WAS INITIATED.  UPON COMPLETION OF BLOW DOWN, THE FITTINGS WERE REMOVED FROM THE PIPELINE AND INSPECTIONS WERE MADE PRIOR TO FINAL REPAIR.  TWO THREADS OF THE NIPPLE APPEARED TO BE STRIPPED AND THE END OF THE NIPPLE WAS EGG SHAPED RESULTING IN IMPROPER SURFACE CONTACT BETWEEN THE THREADS OF THE TWO COUPLED FITTINGS.  FINAL REPAIR CONSISTED OF CUTTING THE THREADED AREA FROM THE NIPPLE AND WELDING A 2"" CAP TO THE NIPPLE OF THE TAP.  THE WELD WAS X-RAYED AND THE PREVIOUSLY INSTALLED NIPPLE AND WELD SADDLE WERE ALSO DYE PENETRANT CHECKED FOR CRACKING.  THE REPAIR WAS THEN COATED AND THE LINE PURGED AND RE-PRESSURIZED.  THE LINE AND ALL CUSTOMERS WAS RESTORED TO NORMAL SERVICE AT 9:OO PM SUNDAY, JANUARY 12, 2003."

ON FEBRUARY 19, 2003, COLUMBIA GAS TRANSMISSION CORPORATION'S (COLUMBIA) PIPELINE SM-90 (8"") WAS DISCOVERED TO BE RELEASING GAS INTO THE KANAWHA RIVER. THE GAS RELEASE WAS DISCOVERED BY A RIVER BOAT EMPLOYEE. HE WAS TRAVELING IN A TUG-BOAT THAT WAS APPROACHING SEVERAL NEAR-BY, LOADED COAL BARGES PARKED NEAR AND OVER THE SM-90 PIPELINE. DURING THIS APPROACH, HE NOTICED THE WATER ""BOILING"", AS WELL AS COLUMBIA'S RIVER CROSSING SIGN ON THE ADJANCENT RIVER BANK. HE THEN BACKED THE TUG UP AND NOTIFIED COLUMBIA. THE PIPELINE WAS OPERATING AT 125 PSIG AT THE TIME OF THE RUPTURE. THE RUPTURE OCCURRED APPROXIMATELY 25 FEET INTO THE KANAWHA RIVER BETWEEN THE CITY OF POINT PLEASANT, WV AND THE COMMUNITY OF HENDERSON, WEST VIRGINIA, BOTH IN MASON COUNTY. SM-90 CROSSES THE KANAWHA RIVER AT THE 1.1 MILE MARK, DECENDING. NO DEATHS OR INJURIES RESULTED FROM THE INCIDENT. A COLUMBIA FIELD EMPLOYEE WAS WORKING AT A NEAR-BY PIPELINE FACILITY WHEN HE NOTICED THE PRESSURE DROP AND ACTED PROMPTLY TO ISOLATE THE RUPTURED PIPELINE SECTION. THE RIVER BOAT COMPANY NOTIFIED THE U.S. COAST GUARD, WHO CLOSED THE RIVER TO BOAT-TRAVEL FROM THE ZERO MILE MARKER TO THE THREE MILE MARKER. THEY ALSO ISSUED A ""PROCEED WITH CAUTION"" ORDER FOR THE OHIO RIVER. BY 3:15 P.M., THE LINE WAS ISOLATED AND THE RIVER WAS RE-OPENED FOR TRAVEL. THE CAUSE OF THE RUPTURE IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION AND IS STILL UNKNOWN. COLUMBIA CUT AND CAPPED SM-90 NEAR THE RIVER CROSSING ON ONE SIDE SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THE INCIDENT. THE OPPOSITE SIDE IS ISOLATED BY A VALVE, WHICH IS CHAINED AND LOCKED. THE PIPELINE WILL REMAIN OUT OF SERVICE UNTIL ARRANGEMENT ARE MADE TO INVESTIGATE THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT AND REPAIR OR REPLACE THE DAMAGED PIPELINE SECTION.6-14-04 FAILURE ANALYSIS COLUMBIA UTILIZED THE SERVICES OF CROFTON DIVING CORPORATION (CROFTON) TO PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL ASSISTANCE DURING THE PIPELINE RUPTURE INVESTIGATION.  ON APRIL 29, 2003, CROFTON CONDUCTED AND UNDERWATER INVESTIGATION.  IN THEIR MAY 6, 2003 UNDERWATER ASSESSMENT REPORT, CROFTON RECORDED THEIR OBSERVATIONS OF THE PIPELINE AND RIVER BOTTOM CONDITION.  (SEE ATTACHMENTS A, B, AND C FROM THIS REPORT).  THEY FOUND THE PIPELINE  TO BE EXPOSED FROM 2.5' TO 24.5' FROM THE EDGE OF WATER (22'IN TOTAL LENGTH).  IN ADDITION, THE PIPELINE HAD BEEN COMPLETELY SERVERED AND HAD SUFFERED OTHER EXTENSIVE DAMAGE. THEY NOTED THE TOP OF THE PIPE HAD BEEN DISTORTED OR FLATTENED TO VARIED DEGREES WITH THE MAXIMUM DEPTH OF DEPRESSION APPROXIMATELY 4"".  THEY ALSO REPORTED NUMEROUS FRESH SCRAPE MARKS TO THE PIPELINE AND IT'S COATING (COAL TAR) IN THIS SECTION INDICATING RECENT BARGE-RELATED DAMAGE DUE TO THEIR BARGE GROUNDING ACTIVITIES.  THE RIVER BOTTOM TOPOGRAPHY HAD REPORTEDLY BEEN ALTERED DUE TO OUTSIDE FORCES RESULTING IN THE 22' OF EXPOSED PIPELINE.  THIS SECTION WAS NOT EXPOSED ON OCTOBER 8, 2202, WHEN CROFTON PERFORMED THEIR ROUTINELY SCHEDULED PIPELINE RIVER CROSSING SURVEY.  BASED ON THE EVIDENCE AND SUPPORTED BY CROFTON'S UNDERWATER CONDITION ASSESSMENT, COLUMBIA HAS CONCLUDED THE CAUSE OF INCIDENT WAS OBIVIOUSLY A STRIKE FROM A RIVER BARGE THAT HAD BEEN GROUNDED INTO RIVER BOTTOM SLOPE AND OUR PIPELINE.  FURTHERMORE, SCOURING OF THE RIVER BOTTOM HAD OCCURRED EITHER PRIOR TO OR DURING THE MOST RECENT GROUNDING EVENT.  THE PIPELINE WAS REPAIRED BY REPLACING THE DAMAGED PIPE SECTION, BACKFILLING WITH SELECT MATERIAL AND THEN PLACING A FLEXIBLE CONCRETE ARTICULATING MAT OVER THE REPAIR AREA.  THIS MAT IS INTENDED PROTECT THE PIPELINE FORM FUTURE UNDERMINING AND DAMAGE. (SEE ATTACHMENT D AND E FROM THIS REPORT) COLUMBIA HAS CONTACTED THE US COAST GUARD ABOUT THE UNSAFE GROUNDING PRACTICES THAT HAVE OCCURRED AT OUR PIPELINE CROSSING LOCATION.  COLUMBIA IS ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF CONTACTING THE TUGBOAT COMPANY(S) TO INFORM THEM OF THE DANGERS AND LIABILITIES OF THESE GROUNDING ACTIVITIES IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO GAS PIPELINE FACILITIES."

THE CONTRACTOR WAS DRAINING ON TANK AND WHILE THAT TANK WAS DRAINING HE ATTEMPTED TO USE A PROPANE TORCH TO THAW A VALVE IN PREPARATION FOR DRAINING ANOTHER TANK.  THE CONTRACTOR HAD NOT HOOKED HIS DRAIN HOSE TO THE SECOND TANK AS IT WAS BEING USED AT THE OTHER TANK.  A KINDER MORGAN EMPLOYEE WITNESSED FLAMES ERUPT FROM A 3"" DRAIN VALVE DURING THE THAWING PROCESS.  THE FIRE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE CONTRACTOR OPENING THE VALVE ON THE TANK WHILE USING THE TORCH.  THIS ALLOWED A PATH FOR AN IGNITION SOURCE TO ENTER THE TANK AND ALSO CAUSED A SMALL RELEASE OF LIQUID WHICH WAS IGNITED BY THE TORCH.  FAILING TO HOOK UP THE HOSE TO THE SECOND TANK BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO THAW THE VALVE IS AGAINST ACCEPTED PRACTICE.  AND OPENING UP THE VALVE WHILE USING THE TORCH IS A VIOLATION AGAINST THE PROCEDURE SET OUT IN OM 103 - HOT WORK AND AGAINST PROCEDURES REVIEWED IN THE KINDER MORGAN CONTRACTOR SAFETY PROGRAM.  UPON EXTINGUISHING THE FIRE AT THE VALVE, THE CONTRACTOR CLAIMS THAT HE HEARD A RUMBLING INSIDE THE TANK, AND HE CLIMBED THE LADDER AND OPENED THE THIEF HATCH TO INVESTIGATE.  THE CONTRACTOR WAS BURNED AFTER HE OPENED THE THEIF HATCH AND WAS EXPOSED TO THE INTENSE HEAT BUILT UP FROM PROBABLE TANK FIRE.  THIS HEAT ESCAPED FROM THE HATCH AND CAUSED 1ST AND 2ND DEGREE BURNS ON HIS FACE AND LEFT HAND.  THE DRIVER WAS ADMITTED TO A LOCAL HOSPITAL FOR OBSERVANCE AND MEDICATED FOR PAIN."

THE FOCUS OF THE RUN WAS THE RIVER CROSSING UNDER THE NECHES RIVER.  NO CORROSION OR OTHER ANOMALIES WERE IDENTIFIED.  THE NECHES RIVER CROSSING IS TYPICAL OF OTHER RIVER CROSSING ON THE TEXOMA PIPELINE.  IN FACT, THE ELEVATION AND SLOPE CHANGE IS MOST SIGNIFICANT AT THIS SITE DUE TO THE DEPTH OF THE CHANNEL FOR SHIPPING.  THERE, HPL, IS CONFIDENT THAT OTHER RIVER CROSSINGS ARE IN SIMILARLY GOOD SHAPE.  THE PIPELINE WAS RETURNED TO SERVICE ON JUNE 6, 2003. 10-15-04 - CORROSION APPEARED TO HAVE OCCURRED DUE TO STANDING WATER IN LOW SPOT OF A DEAD LEG.

THE ACTUAL CAUSE OF THE FIRE IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. LOCAL EMERGENCY PERSONNEL IN CONJUNCTION WITH HPL DECIDED TO LET THE FIRE BURN UNTIL IT COULD BE MORE EASILY EXTINGUISHED. NO INJURIES WERE REPORTED IN THE FIRE AND NO DEATHS OCCURRED. A VOLUNTEER FIREMAN WAS TREATED FOR HEAT EXHAUSTION. BELL HOLES WERE EXCAVATED TO EXAMINE THE PIPELINE FOR POSSIBLE HEAT EFFECTS. NONE WERE DETECTED. NO PIPELINE VALVES OR OTHER SURFACE EQUIPMENT WAS DAMAGED. FOLLOWING EXTINGUISHMENT OF THE FIRE, THE PIGGING OPERATION WAS FINISHED AND THE PIPELINE WAS RETURNED TO SERVICE. NO GAS WAS LOST OR VENTED DUE TO THE FIRE.    FINAL UPDATE...AUGUST 07, 2009    THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED DURING A PIGGING OPERATION OF AN INTRASTATE PIPELINE. PIPELINE PRESSURE WAS EVACUATED DURING THIS LIQUID REMOVAL PROCESS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 50 PSIG OF NATURAL GAS, USED TO PUSH THE MAINTENANCE PIG. FINAL INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THAT A TRANSPORT TRUCK, USED TO HAUL THE CONDENSATE FROM THIS SITE, EXPERIENCED A MALFUNCTION OF A SAFETY SWITCH ON THE DIESEL ENGINE, RESULTING IN IGNITION OF THE VAPORS OFF THE FRAC TANKS.  THE ONLY PRODUCT LOSS DURING THIS INCIDENT WAS THE LIQUID CONDENSATE DURING THE FIRE. PROPERTY DAMAGES WERE LIMITED TO THE FRAC TANKS AND DIESEL TRUCKS OWNED BY THE THIRD PARTY CONTRACTOR. THERE WERE NO ADDITIONAL DAMAGES TO COMPANY FACILITIES OR PROPERTY."

THE DENT, WHICH WAS LOCATED ON THE BODY OF THE PIPE AT APPROXIMATELY THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION, WAS THEORIZED TO BE CAUSED OVER TIME BY A ROCK SITUATED UNDER THE PIPE.  THE DENT DEPTH TO DIAMETER RATIO WAS 2.5% AND THE MAXIMUM AXIAL STRAIN IN THE DENT WAS APPROXIMATELY 22%.  THE CRACK WAS ORIENTED AT AN ANGLE OF APPROXIMATELY 55 DEGREES WITH RESPECT TO THE AXIS OF THE PIPE AND HAD A LENGTH OF APPROXIMATELY 1.25 INCHES.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE CRACK INITIATED ON THE ID PIPE SURFACE.  THE CRACK IS NOT A PUNCTURE FROM A ROCK SINCE A PUNCTURE WOULD INITIATE ON THE OD SURFACE.  THE INITIATION OF CRACKING WAS LIKELY ASSOCIATED WITH DUCTILE TEARING, BASED ON THE HIGH TENSILE STRAINS AT THE DENT APEX ON THE ID SURFACE AND THE 45 DEGREE ANGLE OF THE CRACK WITH RESPECT TO THE PIPE WALL.

THE CRATER DIMENSIONS MEASURED + - 117 FEET IN LENGTH, + - 1 - 2 FEET IN DEPTH, AND VARIED APPROXIMATELY 1 FOOT TO 15 FEET IN WIDTH.  IT APPEARS THAT THERE IS A GAP BETWEEN THE TWO ENDS OF THE PIPE IN THE CRATER MEASURING + - 13.5 FEET. ON 10/7/-2, THREE DAYS AFTER HURRICAN LILI, ANOTHER SIDE SCAN SONAR/ SUB BOTTOM PROFILER SURVEY WAS PERFORMED AT THE PIPELINE INCIDENT BY T. BAKER SMITH & SONS INC.  THE DATA CAPTURED BY THIS SURVEY WAS PLOTTED AND REVIEWED ON 10/9/02.  THE INTERPRETATION OF THIS DATA BY THE SURVEY COMPANY PROJECT MANAGER INDICATED THAT THE WATER DEPTH OVER THE INCIDENT CHANGED BY ABOUT 2 FEET TO 28 FEET.  THE + -13.5 FEET GAP BETWEEN TWO ENDS OF THE PIPE REMAINED THE SAME IN THE CRATER.  IT DID APPEAR THAT THE STORM DID CAUSE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE SUB-SEAN TERRAIN SURROUNDING THE PIPELINE AND THE CRATER.  ON 11/16/2002, THE 12"" PIPELINE WAS CUT AT THE LAND PORTION ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE BELLE PASS TO SEPARATE AND SEGMENT THE PIPELINE (SEE ATTACHED MAP). A 10 - 15 FOOT SECTION OF PIPE WAS REMOVED FROM THE LINE.  A VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE PIPE SECTION REMOVED AND THE END OF THE NORTH SEGMENT PERFORMED AND THERE WERE NO APPARENT DEFECTS INTERNALLY OR EXTERNALLY ON THE STEEL PIPE OR ON THE COATING.  ALSO, THERE WAS NO APPARENT WALL LOSS ON EACH PIECE INSPECTED.  A 12"" PIPELINE RISER WITH A LOR FLANGE AND BLIND WAS INSTALLED ON THE NORTH SECTION  AND THEN WAS RETURNED TO SERVICE. THE SECTION HAD NOT BEEN IN SERVICE SINCE THE 9/5/02 INCIDENT.  THE SOUTH SECTION WAS CAPPED AND REMAINED DEPRESSURIZED.  DISCUSSIONS ARE ON GOING BETWEEN LIGC AS OPERATOR/OWNER OF THE LINE AND THE CUSTOMER ON A SOLUTION TO RESOLVE THE CURRENT STATUS AND CONDTION OF THE SOUTH SEGMENT OF THE PIPELINE THAT INCURRED THE INCIDENT.

AFTER IDENTIFYING THE DAMAGE THAT OCCURRED TO THE COMPRESSION RENTAL COMPANY, (HANOVER COMPANY) WE REEVALUATED AND ARE NOW SUBMITTING A REPORT.  HANOVER PROVIDED THE ATTACHED REPORT MARKED ATTACHMENT 1 CONCERNING THEIR FIRE AT OUR B-117 STATION.    ATTACHMENT 1  1. It id believed that at some point between 10:45 and 18:55, a ?"" nipple supplying the pre/post lube system fractured. This nipple is located on the starting system supply manifold with 120 lb pressure of continuous natural gas flow (it is normal for start systems to have no safety shut-off protection).The nipple was downstream of a 1 1/2"" tee bushed down to a 1 1/2"" and connected to the pre/post lube regular.   2. There is no evidence of gas accumulation and any explosion. It is believed that the leaking gas ignited immediately with the failure of the ?"" nipple.  3. We believed this leaking nipple and ensuing fire created a torching effect to the area above this 1 1/2"" nipple thus potentially    torching the ignition system and /or any surrounding wiring and probably causing unit shutdown. (Note - Fire severely destroyed the unit's safety panel, so exact determination of what actually caused unit to shut down is unknown.)  4. We also believe the 1/2"" nipple completely separated at rapid rate. With full separation there was a stream of 1/2"" 120 psi gas supplying the fire.  5. There are signs of natural gas ""blowing against the coupling guard. (Unlit gas left the separated nipple at 120 psi and ignited after striking the coupling guard 18"" away. The fact that the coupling guard was not distorted and molten aluminum was everywhere but in that area leads us to this conclusion.)  6. This ricocheting flame created heat stress on two cast aluminum starter relay valves (SRV's) and other parts of the unit in the surrounding area.  7. Heat continued and the SRV's failed due to heat distortion thus allowing both 1 1/2"" starter supplies (120 psi) to fuel the fire.  8. At some point in this process, heat distorted the GSOV thus releasing another 1 1/2"" line at 45 psi to fuel the fire. (Note: This was the auto shut-off valve for fuel gas supply to the engine.)  9. Other gas leaks from process cylinder valve cap o-rings and packing probably occurred as the fire continued.  10. The fire continued to burn until discovered and was shut off with the inlet valve to the station by Jeff Murphy (Devon employee)."

GAS CONTROL HAD ALSO RECEIVED ALARM SIGNALS FROM BOTH THE GAS AND FIRE DETECTION SYSTEMS.  AT 12:02 AM ON SEPTEMBER 7, 2004 NORTHERNS OPERATIONS COMMUNICATION CENTER (OCC) RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE OCHILTREE COUNTY, TX SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT REPORTING AN EXPLOSION AND FIRE AT THE NORTHRUP COMPRESSOR STATION.  THE STATION WAS UNMANNED AT THE TIME AND NO INJURIES WERE REPORTED.  THE NORTHRUP COMPRESSOR STATION IS LOCATED 6 MILES SOUTH OF PERRYTOWN, TX ON US HIGHWAY 83.  THE STATION HAS TWO NATURAL GAS COMPRESSOR UNITS AND A STATION DEHYDRATION UNIT, AND COMPRESSES GAS RECEIVED FROM GATHERING FIELDS INTO THE TEXAS A-LINE (TXM10301) UPSTREAM OF THE BEAVER COMPRESSOR STATION.  THE STATION WAS FLOWING 27 MMCF/D AT THE TIME OF THE ESD.  THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS A JACK BOLT ON THE OUTBOUND DISCHARGE VALVE CAP ON COMPRESSOR CYLINDER FOUR OF UNIT ONE CAME LOOSE AND ALLOWED GAS TO ESCAPE INTO THE ENGINE ROOM.  A JACK BOLT IS A VERY LONG BOLT THAT THREADS THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE COMPRESSOR VALVE CAP.  ITS PURPOSE IS TOE PUSH THE VALVE TO THE POINT THAT IT COMPRESSES THE GASKET WHEN THE VALVE IS INSTALLED, THUS FORMING A NECESSARY SEAL.  THE JACK BOLT PROTRUDES OUT OF THE AP COMPLETELY AND HAS A LOCK NUT THAT IS TIGHTENED AGAINST THE CAP.  GAS LEAKING FROM THE MISSING JACK BOLT WAS MOST LIKELY IGNITED BY DEBRIS EXITING THE LEAK AND STRIKING STRUCTURAL STEEL ADJACENT TO THE UNIT. THE RESULTING EXPLOSION CAUSED EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO THE BUILDING SKIN, DOORS, WINDOWS AND LIGHTER SUPPORT PURLINS.  FIRE DAMAGE WAS LIMITED AND MINIMAL.  IN ORDER TO COME LOOSE THE JACK BOLT WOULD HAVE HAD TO LOSE PRELOAD.  PRELOAD COULD HAVE BEEN LOST DUE TO GASKET FAILURE, VALVE FAILURE, IMPROPER TORQUEING, OR IMPROPER VALVE ASSEMBLY.  AN AUGUST 25, 2004 COMPRESSOR ANALYSIS SHOWED NO INDICATION OF IMPROPER VALVE ASSEMBLY.  THERE ARE NO FINDINGS THAT PROVIDE AN ABSOLUTE DETERMINATION OF THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE.  IT MAY HAVE BEEN A COMBINATION OF THE FACTORS ABOVE OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN A FACTOR NOT YET CONSIDERED."

DURING THE STATION BLOW-DOWN, FIRE GATES ON SL-3054 AND SL-3136 FAILED TO CLOSE RESULTING IN A GAS LOST OF 11,758 MCF. THE TOTAL COST FOR THIS INCIDENT WAS $69,907.     FAILURE ANALYSIS     COOK MANLEY CONDUCTED A FAILURE ANALYSIS ON THE UNLOADER BOTTLE (SEE ATTACHED REPORT) AND DETERMINED THAT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS FAILURE WAS A DATA ENTRY ERROR IN THE BOLT SIZING PROGRAM. COOK MANLEY ALSO INVESTIGATED ALL OTHER UNLOADER BOTTLES INSTALLED ON COMPRESSOR UNITS FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND HAVE CONFIRMED THAT CALCULATIONS FOR ALL OTHER ASSEMBLIES ARE CORRECT.    COLUMBIA CONDUCTED A ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS FOR THE ESD FAILURE AND DETERMINED THAT THE 1"" COMPRESSED AIR ESD SUPPLY LINE HAD PLUGGED OFF DUE TO BLACK POWDER LIKE MATERIAL. THE SYSTEM WAS CLEANED AND THE ESD WAS RE-TESTED AND PERFORMED TO SATISFACTION.    REMEDIAL ACTION    COOK MANLEY WILL REPLACE THE AFFECTED ASSEMBLIES. COLUMBIA HAS REQUESTED THAT COOK MANLEY SUPPLY 0.750 INCH BOLTS WITH 16 THREADS PER INCH TO SECURE THE ACTUATOR TO THE VALVE CAP. THIS STUD SIZE IS IN EXCESS OF WHAT IS REQUIRED HOWEVER IT WILL SERVE TO FURTHER BOLSTER THE SAFETY FACTOR ON THIS UNIT.   COOK MANLEY WILL ALSO TAKE THE FOLLOWING CORRECTIVE ACTION TO FURTHER REDUCE THE CHANCES OF SUCH AN ERROR FROM HAPPENING AGAIN:    1) THE COMPUTER PROGRAM WILL BE REVISED TO INCLUDE A NOTE, REMINDING DESIGNERS OF THE IMPLICATIONS AND IMPORTANCE OF USING SUCTION PRESSURE INSTEAD OF AMBIENT PRESSURE.   2) A FUTURE REVISION TO THE PROGRAM WILL REQUIRE THE DESIGNER TO SELECT THE PROPER ASSEMBLY AND THEN PROMPT THE USER FOR THE CORRECT PRESSURE.   3) COOK MANLEY IS REVIEWING ALL OF THE CRITICAL CALCULATIONS IN OUR DESIGNS AND VERIFYING THE RESULTS AUTOMATED CALCULATIONS. THE PURPOSE IS TO IDENTIFY AREAS WHERE A DESIGN ERROR COULD RESULT IN THE RELEASE OF GAS. A LIST OF THESE CALCULATIONS/DECISIONS WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO AN ENGINEERING STANDARD. PROCEDURES WILL BE PUT INTO PLACE REQUIRING THE DRAWING ROOM CHECKER TO REVIEW AND INITIAL A COPY OF THE ENGINEERING STANDARD CERTIFYING THAT THE LIST OF CALCULATIONS WAS CRITICALLY REVIEWED."

STRESS IMPARTED FROM THE CONNECTED PIPING CONTRIBUTED TO SUBSEQUENT CRACK GROWTH.  THE CRACK PROPAGATED FROM THE OUTSIDE SURFACE OF THE BALL VALVE AS EVIDENT BY THE INCREASED CORROSION PRODUCTS FOUND ACROSS THE FRACTURE SURFACE.  MICROSTRUCTURE LIKELY PLAYED A ROLE IN THE CRACK PROPAGATION TOO.  THE PRESENCE OF GRAPHITE FLAKES WITHIN THE MATRIX IS INDICATIVE OF A WEAKER MICROSTRUCTURE.  SEM EXAMINATION OF THE FRACTURE SURFACE INDICATED BRITTLE-LIKE PROPAGATION OF THE CRACK.  THE CHEMICAL ANALYSIS CONFIRMS THAT THE MATERIAL IS A CAST IRON, WITH A CARBON COMPOSITION OF 3 PERCENT."

TEXAS GAS WAS RECEIVING APPROXIMATELY 17 MMCF/D RATE AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.      THE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER BY 12:30 A.M. (CST) DECEMBER 25TH.  AFTER THE INITIAL CALL FROM MR. GILES, GAS CONTROL IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED THE YOUNGSVILLE-MORGAN CITY DISTRICT ONE-CALL PERSON WHO MOBILIZED WITH THREE EMPLOYEES FROM THE MORGAN CITY DISTRICT WHO ARRIVED BY CONTRACTED CREW BOAT AT THE AREA OF THE PLATFORM BY 1:30 A.M. AND FOUND THAT OUR PLATFORM WAS NOT ON FIRE, BUT PIPING 10- TO 15- FEET FROM THE PLATFORM WAS.  THEY PROCEEDED TO ISOLATE THE TEXAS GAS PIPING DOWNSTREAM OF THE AFFECTED FACILITIES.  HILCORP THEN SHUT IN THEIR PRODUCTION AND THERE WERE NO ACTIVE METERS UPSTREAM.  SINCE TRANSCO HAS AN ""INACTIVE"" RISER AND SIDE VALVE INTERCONNECT (NO 8122) ON THE PLATFORM, WE NOTIFIED THEIR GAS CONTROL DEPT PROMPTLY.      AFTER OUR PIPELINE WAS ISOLATED, THE FIRE CONTINUED AT THE SAME RATE.  OUR EMPLOYEES REPORTED THAT THE FIRE APPEARED TO BE ORIGINATING FROM THE TRANSCO PIPELINE AREA.  WE REPORTED THIS TO TRANSCO WHO THEN BEGAN MOBILIZING THEIR EMPLOYEES WHO ARRIVED ONSITE THE MORNING OF DECEMBER 25.  THEY ISOLATED BOTH THEIR 6-INCH GAS PIPELINE AND A 3-INCH LIQUIDS PIPELINE WITH NO IMPACT TO THE FLAME.      AT APPROXIMATELY 10:00 A.M.  DECEMBER 25, AS REPORTED TO US BY A HILCORP ENGINEERING REPRESENTATIVE, THE FLAME GREATLY INTENSIFIED.  TEXAS GAS BELIEVES THAT THIS GREATLY INTENSIFIED FLAME INDICATES THE RUPTURE OF OUR CBD 8"" PIPELINE IN THE RISER LEAVING THE PLATFORM, DUE TO THE HEAT FROM THE FIRE.  AT ABOUT THIS TIME, 10:00 A.M. DECEMBER 25, 2004, HILCORP ENGINEERING BEGAN MANUALLY SHUTTING-IN THEIR PRODUCTION LINES.  THE FIRE DIMINISHED AND SUBSIDED OVER THE NEXT 2 TO 3 HOURS.  WE HAD NO EMPLOYEES AT THE SITE WHEN THIS EVENT OCCURRED AS WE WERE IN THE PROCESS OF CHANGING CREWS AND REFUELING THE BOAT.  THIS INFORMATIONS WAS RELAYED FROM THE HILCORP CREW BOAT THAT WAS ALSO MONITORING THE SITUATION.      TEXAS GAS BELIEVES THAT THE INITIAL FIRE WAS CAUSED BY THE FAILURE AND IGNITION OF A PRODUCTION LINE OWNED BY HILCORP ENGINEERING.  THE HEAT FORM THIS INITIAL FIRE CAUSED TEXAS GAS' CBD 8"" PIPELINE TO RUPTURE.    HILCORP REIMBURSED TEXAS GAS FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE LOSS.  TEXAS GAS REPAIRED THE FACILITY ON PROJECT 46867."

UPON VERIFICATION THE DISTRICT MANAGER CALLED GAS CONTROL AND OTHER COMPANY OFFICIALS OF THE SITUATION.  AT THAT POINT IN TIME THE SSCGP OPERATOR'S CONTINUED THEIR INVESTIGATION AND DISCOVERED THAT THE LEAK AREA WAS CONFINED TO THE CASING UNDER THE ROAD CROSSING AND NO FARTHER AWAY THAN FIVE FEET FROM THE NORTH END OF THE CASING. CENTRAL REGION OPS WAS ADVISED BECAUSE HIGHWAY 400 WAS INVOLVED AND THEY ADVISED MONITORING THE LEAK AS A PRECAUTION.  TEST HOLES WERE ESTABLISHED AND WERE CHECKED THREE TIMES PER DAY AS ADVISED BY THE OPS.  ON JANUARY 25TH THE DAY WAS SPENT FILLING OUT PAPERWORK AND CALLING IN ONE CALLS TO ESTABLISH WHERE THE OTHER UTILITIES WERE IN THE AREA.  ALSO, ON THIS DAY, UNDER THE ADVISE OF THE OPS, WE WERE ASKED TO LOWER THE LINE PRESSURE FROM 253# TO 200#.   THIS FUNCTION WAS PERFORMED.  ON JANUARY 26TH SSCGP EMPLOYEES SHOWED UP ON SITE TO PERFORM EXCAVATION TO SEE IF THE LEAK COULD BE FOUND.  UPON EXCAVATION A LEAK WAS FOUND OUTSIDE OF THE END OF THE CASING ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY.  SSCGP EMPLOYEES INSTALLED A MECHANICAL SPLIT REPAIR SLEEVE AND STOPPED THE LEAK.  AT THE TIME THE LEAK WAS THOUGHT TO BE CONTAINED AND SSCGP EMPLOYEES WOULD COME BACK WHEN WEATHER PERMITTED AND REPLACE THE PIPE.  UPON COMPLETION OF BACKFILLING OF THE LEAK AREA THE DISTRICT MANAGER ASKED THE OPERATOR TO CHECK THE CASING VENT ONCE AGAIN FOR LEAKAGE.  AT THE TIME IT WAS THOUGHT THAT MAYBE THE SATURATED SOIL WAS STILL SETTING OFF THE LEAK DETECTOR.  THE DISTRICT MANAGER ADVISED THE OPERATOR TO RELEASE NITROGEN IN THE VENT MARKER IN HOPES THAT THIS WOULD NEUTRALIZE THE SOIL OR CONTENTS OF THE CASING THAT MIGHT BE SATURATED WITH NATURAL GAS. THE OPERATORS DID SO AND WAITED APPROXIMATELY 20 MINUTES.  USING THE PRAGMATICS THE CASING VENT WAS CHECKED ONCE AGAIN. GAS LEAKAGE WAS DETECTED.  LINE PRESSURE WAS LEFT AT 200# AND MONITORING FOR LEAKAGE WAS CONTINUED.  ON JANUARY 25TH SSCGP EMPLOYEES MET WITH CONTRACT EMPLOYEES AND IMMEDIATELY STARTED THE PROCESS FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE 400/77 HIGHWAY CROSSING.

THE AIR DRYER WAS ISOLATED AND AIR PRESSURE BUILT BACK UP, AND THE GAS VENT VALVES CLOSED.  THE AIR SYSTEMS PRESSURE DROPPED DUE TO THE AIR LINE HOSE FAILURE, BUT THE AIR COMPRESSURE CONTINEUED TO SUPPLY AIR, ULTIMATELY HOLDING A PRESSURE OF 35# IN TEH AIR SYTEM.  ONCE THE AIR DRYER WAS ISOLATED, AIR PRESSURE BUILT BACK UP AND THE GAS VENT VALVES CLOSED.    MAINTAINING THE 35# EQUILIBRIUM RESULTED IN A PRESSURE LOW ENOUGH TO TRIP THE GAS VENTING VALVES (65# DESIGNED SET  POINT) TO ATMPOSPHERE BUT NOT LOWE ENOUGH TO CLOSE THE BLOCK VALVLES (30# DESIGNED SET POINT) WHICH WOULD HAVE ISOLATED TRANSMISSION LINES 235 AND 3000 FROM THE STATION.    UPON DISCOVERY OF THE HOSE FAILURE, THE AIR DRYER WAS BYPASSED AND REMOVED FROM SERVICE.  STATION PERSONNEL REMAINED AT THE STATION THROUGH THE NIGHT OT MONITOR OPERATIONS.    THE STATION WAS PLACED BACK ONLINE AT APPROXIMATELY 8:45 PM.    DUE TO QUICK ACTION BY GAS OPERATIONS TO MAINTAIN THE GAS SYSTEM AND BY PUTTING STORAGE ON WITHDRAWAL, THERE WAS NO LOSS OF SERVICE OR CUSTOMER IMPACT.    NOTE:  THE VENTING OF GAS TO ATMOSPHERE WAS NOT THE RESULT OF ANY MALFUCTION OF THE ESD SYSTEM NOR A TRIGGER OF THE ESD SYSTEM.  DURING THIS INCIDENT, THE ESD SYSTEM COULD HAVE BEEN ACTUATED BY A NUMBER OF SAFETY-TRIGGERED CONDITIONS, AND THIS WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A COMPLETE ISOLATION AND BLOW-DOWN OF THE STATION.    IMMEDIATE MITIGATION EFFORTS    UNTIL COMPLETEION OF COMPREHENSIVE ENGINEERING ANALYSIS, THE AIR DRYER WILL REMAIN OUT OF SERVICE.    A NITROGEN SUPPLY SYSTEM TO PROVIDE BACK-UP PRESSURE TO THE ESD SYSTEM NOT INSTALLED ON FRIDAY JULY 15, 2005.  THE SYTEM IS SET TO PROVIDE CONSTANT 80# OF NITROGEN FEED TO THE ESD SYSTEM, SHOULD THE EXISTING SYSTEM PRESSURE DROP BELOW 80#.  THE NITROGEN FEED IS SUPPLIED THROUGH A CHECK VALVE AND ORIFICE SO AS TO NOT IMPACT OR AFFECT NORMAL OPERATION OF THE ESD SYSTEM, IF ACTUATED.    ON GOING ENGINEERING REVIEW OF CURRENT AIR SYSTEMS AT NEW BETTER STATION (STARTING AIR, UTILITY AIR, AND INSTRUMENT AIR), AND WILL IMPLEMENT ANY MODIFICATIONS IDENTIFIED FROM ENGINEERING REVIEW DEEMED NECESSARY.

AND ROGER B CHAFFEE BOULEVARD IN THE CITY OF WYOMING, MICHIGAN.  IN RESPONSE TO THIS NOTICE, A MICHCON REPRESENTATIVE VISITED THE SITE ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2005, AND PROVIDED TEMPORARY MARKINGS CONSISTING OF FLAGS AND PAINT IN THE AREA REQUESTED.  MICHCON'S REPRESENTATIVE CONTACTED DEWITT'S REPRESENTATIVE AT THE SITE AND DISCUSSED THE LIMITS OF THE WORK AND THE METHODS TO BE USED.  DEWITT'S REPRESENTATIVE WAS VERBALLY MADE AWARE OF THE PRESENCE OF A 22"" 300 PSI PIPELINE UNDER THE WESTBOUND LANES OF 44TH STREET, BUT BECAUSE OF HEAVY VEHICLE TRAFFIC IN THE AREA PAINT MARKS WOULD BE HAZARDOUS TO MAKE AND WOULD NOT LAST FROM VEHICLE WEAR.  DEWITT'S REPRESENTATIVE STATED TO MICHCON'S REPRESENTATIVE THAT HE WOULD NOT NEED STAKING ON TEH NORTHWEST CORNER BECAUSE PLASTIC CONDUITS HAD ALREADY BEEN RUN UNDERNEATH THE NEW ROADWAY ON THE NORTH SIDE AND THAT THE BORING WORK WOULD NOT EXTEND TO THE NORTHWEST CORNER, SO MARKINGS FOR THE 22"" PIPELINE WERE NOT NECESSARY.    ON OCTOBER 4, 2004 AT APPROXIMATELY 10:50 AM MICHCON RECEIVED A REPORT THAT A PIPLINE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY AN EXCAVATOR AT THE CORNER OF 44TH STREET SE AND ROGER B CHAFFEE BOULEVARD.  RESPONDING TO THAT REPORT, MICHCON ARRIVED AT THE SITE AT 11:03 AM AND FOUND THAT THE 22"" 300 PSI PIPELINE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY A BORING MACHINE OPERATED BY DEWITT.  THE 2-INCH BORING HEAD HAD PUNCTURED THE 22"" PIPE AT A DEPTH OF APPROXIMATELY 41 INCHES FROM STREET GRADE; THE TOP OF THE 22"" PIPE WAS FOUND AT 36 INCHES BELOW STREET GRADE.  DEWITT'S REPRESENTATIVE STATED TO MICHCON THAT HE KNEW THE PIPELINE WAS THERE BUT THAT HE DECIDED TO BORE IN THE AREA OF THE 22"" PIPELINE ANYWAY, AND THAT HE THOUGH THE 22"" PIPELINE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEEPER AT THAT LOCATION.    NOTE: ALTHOUGH MISS DIGS WAS NOTIFIED AND RESPONDED AND RESPONDED TO THE AREA, THERE WERE NO MISS DIGS MARKS AT THE LOCATION OF THE DAMAGE.

THE FIRE WAS QUARANTINED DUE TO THE CONCERN OF EMPLOYEE EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS. AN INITIAL ASSESSMENT WAS PERFORMED AND DETERMINED THE EVENT TO BE AN OIL FIRE CAUSED BY A TUBING LEAK AND BROKEN SIGHT GLASS WHICH CONTINUED  TO FEED OIL INTO THE FIRE. SINCE THERE APPEARED TO BE NO GAS RELEASE AND DUE TO THE COFINED NATURE OF THE FIRE,TEXAS EASTERN DETERMINED IT DID NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A REPORTABLE INCIDENT.      AN AIR MONITORING CONTRACTOR WAS BROUGHT IN AND VERIFIED NO ASBESTOS HAD BEEN RELEASED AND THE QUARANTINE WAS LIFTED ON THURSDAY APRIL 13, ALLOWING A MORE THOROUGH INVESTIGATION TO PROCEED AFTER THE EASTER HOLIDAY.  THE INVESTIGATION WAS COMPLETED LATE ON TUESDAY, APRIL 18 AND FOUND ROD PACKING DAMAGE ON ONE OF THE COMPRESSOR CYLINDERS WHICH CAUSED A SMALL GAS LEAK INTO THE CRANKCASE.

LESLIE STEVENS  COMPLIANCE COORDINATOR  832-214-1649  LESLIE.STEVENS@ENBRIDGE.COM    THE FOLLOWING IS BASED ON INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THE CONTRACTOR AND ITS EMPLOYEES AND THE ONE ENBRIDGE EMPLOYEE AT THE SITE. THE INITIAL OPERATION INVOLVED THE REPLACEMENT OF A 20 LOOP LINE VALVE LOCATED ON THE 20 LOOP LINE.  PARALLEL TO THE 20 LOOP LINE IS ENBRIDGES 22 MAIN LINE.  THE LOOP LINE AND MAIN LINE ARE CONNECTED BY AN 18 CROSSOVER LINE.  THE 18 CROSSOVER LINE VALVE HAD BEEN CLOSED AND THE 20 LOOP LINE SEGMENT HAD BEEN ISOLATED AT THE MAIN HEADER SOUTH OF THE 20 LOOP LINE VALVE TO BE REPLACED AND AT ANOTHER LOOP LINE VALVE LOCATED TO THE NORTH OF THE EXCAVATED SITE.  THE ISOLATED SEGMENT WAS BLED DOWN TO ATMOSPHERE AT THIS POINT.  THE 18 CROSSOVER LINE VALVE HAD BEEN SKIDDED OR SUPPORTED WITH BLOCKS SO THERE WOULD BE NO MOVEMENT WHEN THE 18 CROSSOVER LINE WOULD BE CUT DOWNSTREAM OF THE 18 CROSSOVER LINE VALVE.  CUTS ONE, TWO AND THREE WERE THEN MADE. THE NOW FREE TEE SECTION WAS REMOVED FROM THE EXCAVATION AS WAS THE WEST CONCRETE WALL OF THE 18 CROSSOVER LINE VALVE BOX.  THE SKIDDED 18 CROSSOVER LINE VALVE REMAINED STABLE AND UNMOVED AFTER THE CUTS WERE MADE.  THE PORTION OF THE 20 LOOP LINE CONTAINING THE 20 LOOP LINE VALVE TO BE REPLACED, EXPOSED IN THE EXCAVATION, WAS CUT AGAIN (CUT 4) ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE 20 LOOP LINE VALVE.  THIS LEFT THE 20 LOOP LINE VALVE FREE TO BE REMOVED FOR REPLACEMENT.  BECAUSE THE 20 LOOP LINE SEGMENT HAD A HUGE BLOCK OF CONCRETE POURED AROUND IT FOR SUPPORT WHEN ORIGINALLY LAID, THE BLOCK OF CONCRETE HAD TO BE BROKEN UP IN ORDER FOR THE 20 LOOP LINE VALVE AND 20 LOOP LINE CUT SEGMENT TO BE LIFTED OUT OF THE EXCAVATION.  CONTRACTORS CREWS BEGAN JACK HAMMERING ON THE BLOCK OF CONCRETE AND WITHIN 30 MINUTES TO AN HOUR THE GAS RELEASE OCCURRED.  LATER IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT A COUPLING  ON THE 18 CROSSOVER LINE BETWEEN THE 18CROSSOVER LINE VALVE AND THE 22 MAIN LINE, WHICH WAS STILL UNDER PRESSURE, HAD UNCOUPLED.   ALSO PRESENT BETWEEN THE EXCAVATION AND THE COUPLING ON THE 18 CROSSOVER LINE WAS AN OLD ABANDON UNEXPOSED CISTERN.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THESE WERE THE THREE MAIN CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE RELEASE EVENT.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE CROSSOVER COUPLING PROVIDED MINIMAL STRENGTH, TO THE HORIZONTAL PRESSURE CREATED WHEN THE 18 CROSSOVER LINE WAS CUT AND REMOVED FROM THE 20 LOOP LINE AND THAT THE ABANDON CISTERN PROVIDED REDUCED SOIL COMPACTION, VOLUME AND STRENGTH HOLDING CAPACITIES AFTER THE CUT AND REMOVAL WERE MADE.  FINALLY, THE JACK HAMMERING ON THE CONCRETE POURED OVER THE CUT 20 LOOP LINE PROVIDED EXTERNAL VIBRATION TO THE REDUCED VOLUME OF UNDISTURBED, COMPACTED SOIL CREATED BY THE CISTERN. A SKETCH OF THE INCIDENT AREA WAS NOT ATTACHED BECAUSE OF LIMITATIONS REGARDING THE OPS ONLINE DATA ENTRY AND OPERATOR REGISTRATION SYSTEM, HOWEVER A SKETCH CAN BE PROVIDED UPON REQUEST."

THE LEAK WAS AT THE LOCATION OF A NEW HOT TAP INSTALLATION WE HAD MADE ON THIS PIPELINE EARLIER IN 2006 AND THE LEAK RATE WAS MINIMAL.  AFTER INITIAL REVIEW, A DECISION WAS MADE TO TAKE THE PIPELINE OUT OF SERVICE SO IT COULD BE FURTHER EVALUATED.  THIS ACTION WAS THE INITIAL ACTION THAT MADE THE INCIDENT REPORTABLE TO THE RAILROAD COMMISSION OF TEXAS.  THE NOTIFICATION TO THE STATE OCCURED WITHIN TWO HOURS OF THAT DECISION AND WAS MADE ON NOVEMBER 25, 2006 BY DOUG MENKE, OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR.  OUR INITIAL ASSUMPTION WAS PROVEN TO BE CORRECT IN THAT WE CONFIRMED THAT WE HAD A LEAKING HOT TAP CLAMP.  THE CLAMP VENDOR TRAVELLED TO THE LOCATION TO INJECT SEALANT IN THE HOT TAP FITTING TO TRY AND STOP THE LEAK.  IT WAS CONFIRMED AT THAT TIME THAT THE PIPE WAS ALSO LEAKING AND THAT A REPAIR OF A LEAKING SEAL WOULD NOT HANDLE THE REPAIR.  A DECISION WAS MADE THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO CUT OUT PIPE AND REPLACE THE HOT TAP ASSEMBLY AND LEAKING PIPE.  THIS DECISION CAUSED THE REPAIR COST ESTIMATE TO NOW EXCEED THE $50,000 REPORTING THRESHOLD.  OPERATIONS NOTIFED COMPLIANCE OF THIS DECISION VIA AN EMAIL ON THE MORNING OF DECEMBER 11, 2006.  BASED ON THIS NEW INFORMATION NOTIFICATION OF THIS BEING A REPORTABLE INCIDENT WAS MADE TO THE NRC.  THE FITTING ASSEMBLY AND PIPE WERE SENT TO A METALLURGIST FOR EXAMINATION.  THE METALLUGICAL ANALYSIS REPORTED THAT ONE OF THE SEALS ON THE HOT TAP CLAMP DID NOT SEAT PROPERLY AND OVER A PERIOD OF TIME BEGAN TO LEAK GAS INTO THE CAVITY BETWEEN THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SEAL.

AT 23:28 ON 12/6/06, WHILE THE SOUTHWEST GAS CREW WAS REMOVING DIRT, DAMAGE OCCURED ON THE 16-INCH PIPE NEAR THE FILLET WELD FOR THE 2-INCH SIDE-TAP VALVE STUB, CAUSING LEAKAGE TO OCCUR.  SOUTHWEST IMMEDIATELY IMPLEMENTED THE INCIDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.  ATMOSPHERIC GAS DETECTED IN THE PARKING GARAGE AT THE NEW YORK-NEW YORK HOTEL DURING THE INITIAL PERIMETER SURVEY RESULTED IN CLOSURE OF THE GARAGE.  THE INCIDENT PERIMETER WAS SECURED AT 01:15 ON 12/07/06.  THE PERIMETER WAS LATER EXPANDED AT 03:20 ON 12/7/06 DUE TO SHIFTING WINDS.

THE HUTCHINSON FRACTIONALIZATION PLANT WAS NOTIFIED THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR GAS. THE RENO COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT ASKED BNSF RAILROAD TO SHUT DOWN OPERATIONS IN THE AREA OF THE LEAK. THE TANK TRUCKS BEGAN HOLDING UP THE TWO CITIES AT 1:00 AM ON FEBRUARY SIXTH AND THE FRACTIONALIZATION PLANT WAS SHUT IN. THE MAIN LINE GATES WERE CLOSED AND THE BLOW DOWN BEGAN. THE RAILROAD TRACKS WERE RE-OPENED AT 4:45 AM. THE LINE WAS DUG UP AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT A CRACKED WELD WAS THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK. THE LINE WAS CAPPED ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE BNSP RAILROAD TRACKS AND ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF HIGHWAY 50 LEAVING THE SECTION UNDER THE RAILROAD TRACKS AND HIGHWAYS ISOLATED FOR MORE INSPECTIONS.  3/12/08 A SUPPLEMENTAL AND FINAL REPORT OF THIS INCIDENT IS BEING MADE TO CHANGE THE COST OF GAS LOSS ONLY.

THIS GAS COST IS BASED ON ACTUAL GAS LOSSES AT A SYSTEM AVERAGE COST OF $5.50/MCF IN JANUARY 2007 AND $7.01/MCF IN FEBRUARY 2007. THIS UNDETECTABLE LEAK RESULTED FROM A FAILED GIRTH WELD WHICH CREATED A NARROW CRACK-LIKE OPENING ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PIPE LOCATED IN A REMOTE AREA.  THE GAS ESCAPED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE THROUGH NUMEROUS SMALL HOLES AND CRACKS IN THE GROUND. THE PRESSURES MONITORED UP AND DOWN STREAM OF THE LEAK VIA THE SCADA SYSTEM ALSO DID NOT INDICATE THAT ANYTHING WAS ABNORMAL ON THAT LINE.

THE SUCTION PRESSURE TO THE STATION, COMING FROM EL PASO AND CIG WAS CLOSE TO 500 PSIG. AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT THERE WAS ABOUT 354 MMCF OF GAS GOING THROUGH THE SUNRAY PLANT, 224 MMCF FROM CIG, 100 MMCF FROM EL PASO AND 30 MMCF FROM BP. THE POWER LOSE CAUSED ALL COMPRESSOR ENGINES TO SHUT DOWN. NORTHERN'S GAS CONTROL IMMEDIATELY NOTIFED ALL THREE CUSTOMERS (CIG, EL PASO AND BP)REQUESTING THEY REDUCE HORSEPOWER AND FLOW DELIVERIES UNTIL THE SUNRAY COMPRESSOR STATION COULD BE PLACED BACK IN SERVICE. THE TXM-15701 SUCTION PRESSURE VERY QUICKLY REACHED 572 PSIG, WHICH IS THE SET POINT OF THE RELIEF VALVE FOR THAT PIPELINE. THE RELIEF VALVE STAYED OPEN, BLOWING GAS TO ATMOSPHERE, FOR APPROXIMATELY 26 MINUTES UNTIL EL PASO AND CIG WERE ABLE TO REDUCE FLOW ENOUGH TO ALLOW IT TO CLOSE.

A FINAL COST OF REPAIR WAS CALCULATED AT $120,455. THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS DUE TO A LACK OF FUSION IN THE ROOT PASS DURING CONSTRUCTION. THE LACK OF FUSION CRACKED INTO THE FILL PASSES AND EVENTUALLY PENETRATED THE CAP PASS TO BECOME A LEAK. THE ROOT CAUSE HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO MOSTLY LIKELY BE PIPE BENDING STRESSES ON THE PIPELINE CAUSING THE WELDS TO CONTINUE TO CRACK OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. LONG TERM ADDITIONAL ACTIONS ARE BEING FOLLOWED THROUGH WITH HOWEVER THESE COST ARE CONSIDERED TO BE COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE LONG TERM INTEGRITY OF THE LINE AND NOT REPAIR COSTS.   SUPPLEMENT TO FINAL REPORT - THIS SUPPLEMENT IS SUBMITTED TO INDICATE THAT THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS A WELD FAILURE ON A GIRTH WELD. LABORATORY ANALYSIS AND CONFIRMATION REVIEW BY P-PIC (A CONSULTANT) INDICATE THAT A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR WAS THE QUALITY OF THE WELD AS IT INDICATED INADEQUATE PENTETRATION IN THE ROOT PASS.

BYRON WOOD	4023987396	BYRON.WOOD@NNGCO.COM	4023987606	"ON AUGUST 10, 2007 NORTHERN NATURAL GAS COMPLETED NSTALLATION OF A 24-INCH PIGABLE BYPASS PIPING TO FACILITATE REMOVAL OF LATERAL LINES TO THE NORTHERN NATURAL GAS COMPRESSION PLATFORM MI 686 C-CMP. ALL WORK WAS COMPLETED AND THE PIPING WAS RE-PRESSURIZED AND LEAK TESTED. LATE THAT DAY PERSONNEL IN AIRCRAFT WITNESSED BUBBLES ON THE OCEAN SURFACE IN THE WORK AREA THAT WERE INDICATIVE OF A GAS LEAK FROM THE PIPING. PRODUCER PLATFORMS WERE NOTIFIED TO SHUT-IN AND THE LINE WAS ISOLATED. THIS WAS REPORTED TO MMS AND THE COAST GUARD. PRESSURE WAS REDUCED ON THE LINE. A REPAIR PLAN WAS SUBMITTED TO & APPROVED BY MMS. INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT THERE WAS A SMALL CRACK ON A 2-INCH BYPASS LINE THAT WENT AROUND A 24-INCH SUB SEA BLOCK VALVE. WHILE WORKING ON REPAIRING THIS LEAK BY REMOVING THE 2 INCH CONNECTION PIPING TO THE 24-INCH LINE AS WELL AS THE SADDLE TO FACILITATE INSTALLATION OF A 24-INCH LEAK CLAMP, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE 2-INCH CONNECTION ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BLOCK VALVE WAS ALSO CRACKED. A REVISED REPAIR PLAN WAS SUBMITTED AND APPROVED BY MMS. THE REVISED PLAN CALLED FOR REMOVAL OF THE TWO INCH PIPE AND SADDLE IDENTICAL TO WHAT WAS COMPLETED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VALVE AND INSTALLATION OF A HIGH PRESSURE, FULL ENCIRCLEMENT, BOLT-ON LEAK CLAMP. BOTH LEAK CLAMPS WERE INSTALLED AND A LEAK TEST AT NORMAL OPERATING PRESSURE WAS CONDUCTED FOR 2 HOURS. THERE WERE NO LEAKS OBSERVED AND THE PIPING WAS WRAPPED AND SANDBAGGED TO ORIGINAL COVER. THIS WAS COMPLETED ON AUGUST 31, 2007. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE LEAKS IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION AS IT IS THOUGHT THAT THE CONTRACTOR CRACKED THE PIPE WHEN INSTALLING SANDBAGS AFTER THE 24 INCH BYPASS LINE INSTALLATION WAS COMPLETE. A METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS IS BEING CONDUCTED ON THE 2-INCH REMOVED PIPING. A SUPPLEMENTAL/FINAL REPORT IS BEING FILED WITH UPDATE TO THE COST OF GAS LOSS AND REPAIRS."

THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT EXITINGUISHED THE FIRE. INVESTIGATION INTO THE INCIDENT FOUND THAT THE FIRE HAD OCCURRED ON THE DEHYDRATOR SKID WITH MOST OF THE DAMAGE CENTERED AT THE VARIABLE FREQUENCY DRIVE (VFD) FOR THE GLYCOL PUMPS, WHICH IS BELIEVED TO BE THE ORIGIN OF THE FIRE. IT APPEARS THE FIRE WAS FUELED BY HYDROCARBON CONDENSATE AND GLYCOL SPILLING OUT THE OVERFLOW VENT STACK, LOCATED ON THE DEHYDRATOR SKID, ONTO THE VFD CONTROLS FOR THE VFD. THE POSITIONING OF THE VFD AS IT RELATED TO THE OVERFLOW VENT STACK WAS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR. ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION INDICATES THAT AS SOME POINT THE GLYCOL RECIRCULATING PUMPS MUST HAVE STOPPED WORKING WHICH ALLOWED THE MIXTURE OF HYDROCARBON CONDENSTATE AND GLYCOL TO DRAIN BACK TO THE OVERFLOW TANK RESULTING IN A SPILL FROM THE OVERFLOW PIPING ONTO THE VFD CONTROLS. NORTHERN IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH EQUIPMENT VENDORS TO ACQUIRE COST AND AVILABILITY OF REPLACING THE DEHYDRATOR UNIT. A CURRENT ESTIMATE OF REPLACEMENT IS ESTIMATED AT APPROXIMATELY $140,000.  SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT FILED TO INDICATE/CLARIFY PART A, ITEM G CLASS LOCATION DESCRIPTION IS: ONSHORE, CLASS 1.  SUPPLEMENTAL/FINAL REPORT - A FINAL COST OF $152,907 HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO REPLACE THE DAMAGED DEHY UNIT AND THE ASSOCIATED ELECTRICAL AND CONTROL PANELS.

REPORTED A NATURAL GAS AND CONDENSATE RELEASE FROM THEIR 6-INCH UNDERGROUND TRANSMISSION PIPELINE IN DE SOTO PARISH, LOUISIANA. THE RELEASE WAS CAUSED BY A  BACKHOE STRIKING AND DAMAGING THE PIPELINE DURING EXCAVATION. CROSSTEX REPORTED THE UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE TO THE LOUISIANA EMERGENCY HAZARDOUS MATERIALS HOTLINE (INCIDENT NO. 07-06604), AND THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) WAS ALSO NOTIFIED OF THE EVENT (INCIDENT NO. 853067).    AFTER THE INITIAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE, IT WAS DETERMINED DURING THE INVESTIGATION THAT THE CAUSE OF THE RELEASE AND SUBSEQUENT CONDENSATE SPILL WAS FROM AN UNIDENTIFIED TAP VALVE THAT WAS INADVERTENTLY BROKEN OFF BY A CONTRACTOR UTILIZING EXCAVATION EQUIPMENT DURING CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES, CREATING AN APPROXIMATE 2-INCH HOLE IN THE PIPELINE. CROSSTEX PERSONNEL WERE PREVIOUSLY UNAWARE OF THE PRESENCE OF SUCH TAP VALVE AS IT WAS NOT INDICATED ON FACILITY DRAWINGS. CROSSTEX PERSONNEL ON THE SCENE OF THE INCIDENT QUICKLY ISOLATED THE AFFECTED PIPELINE SEGMENT, AND CAREFULLY EXCAVATED AROUND THE DAMAGED TAP VALVE GAINING ACCESS TO THE DAMAGED PORTION OF THE PIPELINE. REPAIRS TO THE PIPELINE AND PURGING ACTIVITIES WERE FINALIZED BY 1645 HOURS AND GAS SERVICE TO THE TOWN OF LOGANSPORT WAS RESTORED BY 1750 HOURS THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT.    THERE WAS ONE INJURY ASSOCIATED WITH INCIDENT WHICH OCCURRED WHEN THE CONTRACT BACKHOE OPERATOR EXITED THE EXCAVATOR AND TWISTED HIS KNEE. HE WAS TAKEN TO A LOCAL HOSPITAL FOR A DOCTOR'S EXAMINATION AND WAS RELEASED THE SAME DAY. HOWEVER IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT ADDITIONAL TREATMENT WILL BE REQUIRED DUE THE NATURE OF THE INJURY.    200 MCF (THOUSAND CUBIC FEET)OR APPROXIMATELY 9,341 POUNDS OF SWEET NATURAL GAS AND LESS THAN TWO (2) BARRELS OF CONDENSATE WERE RELEASED.

THE FACTORS IDENTIFIED INCLUDED POSSIBLE INCORRECT ATTACH FLANGE BOLT TORQUE VALUE READINGS DURING THE FINAL MANUFACTURING SHOP ASSEMBLY, WHICH COULD ALLOW EXCESS ATTACH FLANGE DEFLECTION, AND SLIGHT BOLT RELAXATION DURING HYDROTESTING.  THE O-RING DESIGN, DIMENSION, AND DISSIMILAR MATERIALS WERE ALSO A FACTOR.  AFTER OFFSHORE INSTALLATION OF THE FLEX-JOINT AND DURING PIPELINE OPERATIONS, FRETTING BEGAN TO TAKE PLACE WITHIN THE O-RING SEAL SYSTEM.  THIS DEVELOPMENT THEN LED TO THE PROGRESSION OF MINOR CORROSION, AND INDUCTION OF SEA WATER, WHICH AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME PROGRESSED UNTIL THE LEAK STARTED.    DURING THE OFFSHORE REPAIR PHASES, CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WERE IMPLEMENTED TO ADDRESS EACH OF THE POTENTIAL CAUSES, WHICH INCLUDED A NEWLY DESIGNED LARGER O-RING WHICH IS NOW THE SAME MATERIAL AS THE ATTACH FLANGE, AND ACCURATE BOLT TORQUING MEASURED AND VERIFIED BY UT STUD ELONGATION PROCESS.

THE LEAK SITE IS LOCATED IN SECTION 21, TOWNSHIP 6N, RANGE 5E, GAGE COUNTY, NE. NORTHERN PERSONNEL UTILIZED A BOTTLE TRUCK AT THE CLATONIA TOWN BORDER STATION TO PROVIDE GAS SERVICE TO THE TOWN WHILE THE BRANCH LINE WAS SHUT OFF FROM THE TAKE OFF TO THE TBS TO SAFELY ASSESS AND REPAIR THE LINE. THIS LINE'S CONSTRUCTION INCLUDES DRESSER COUPLING, ELECTRIC WELDS AND SCREWED COUPLINGS. UPON ASSESSMENT, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE THREADS ON THE PIPE GOING INTO A TWO-INCH SCREWED COUPLING HAD FAILED RESULTING IN LEAKING GAS. LINE PRESSURE WAS REDUCED TO ZERO AND REPAIRS WERE MADE BY CUTTING OUT THE FAILED COUPLING ALONG WITH SMALL PIECES OF THE LINE, ON EACH SIDE OF THE COUPLING, AND INSTALLING APPROXIMATELY 10 FEET OF NEW, TESTED TWO-INCH, .218 WALL THICKNESS PIPE. PRESSURE WAS RESTORED TO 100 PSIG AND THE COMPLETE 1.26 MILES OF LINE WAS INSTRUMENT LEAK DETECTED. THE PRESSURE WAS THEN INCREASED TO NORMAL OPERATING PRESSURE AND THE FULL LENGTH OF THE LINE WAS AGAIN INSTRUMENT LEAK DETECTED. UPON SUCCESSFUL LOADING OF THE LINE TO NORMAL PRESSURE AND NO LEAKS DISCOVERED NORMAL GAS SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO THE TOWN BORDER STATION OF CLATONIA. THE SMALL PIECES OF PIPE AND THE FAILED COUPLING ARE BEING SENT TO A LABORATORY FOR FAILURE ANALYSIS TO ASSIST WITH DETERMINING THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE FAILURE. THERE WAS NO FIRE, NO INJURIES AND NO LOSS OF SERVICE AS THERE ARE NO FARM TAP CUSTOMERS ON THE LINE AND THE CLATONIA TOWN BORDER STATION SERVICE WAS MAINTAINED WITH A BOTTLE TRUCK.

UPON REVIEW OF THE INFORMATION IT APPEARED THAT THERE WAS A DETECTION OF A SINGLE METHANE INDICATION IN LAKE COUNTY, MN ON THE 16-INCH RESERVE (MNB69801) BRANCH LINE ON THE PIPELINE RIGHT OF WAY APPROXIMATELY 1.1 MILES WEST OF LAX LAKE ROAD @ APPROXIMATE MILEPOST 59.5. NORTHERN PERSONNEL PROCEEDED TO REDUCE THE PRESSURE FROM 405 TO 300 PSIG AND SENT PERSONNEL TO THE SITE TO UTILIZE PORTABLE LEAK DETECTION EQUIPMENT TO VERIFY IF THERE WAS A LEAK. A LEAK WAS DETECTED @ THE APPROXIMATE LOCATION INDICATED. A STRONG HYDRO CARBON SMELL WAS DETECTED, A READING OF 5% LEL WAS INDICATED AND A PATCH OF DEAD VEGETATION APPROXIMATELY 15 FT IN DIAMETER WAS NOTED. ACTIONS WERE TAKEN TO ACQUIRE THE SERVICES OF A CONTRACTOR AND ARRANGE FOR NORTHERN'S STOPPLE CREW TO PROCEED TO THE SITE. AN 8-INCH STOPPLE AND BYPASS WAS INSTALLED AROUND THE LEAK AREA, THEN THE SECTION OF LINE WAS BLOWN DOWN AND EXCAVATED. A ROCK WAS FOUND TO HAVE IMPINGED ON THE PIPELINE AT THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION. THE IMPINGMENT RESULTED IN A DENT MEASURING APPROXIMATELY 11 INCHES LONGITUDINALLY, SEVEN INCHES CIRCUFERENTIALLY AND 0.903 INCHES DEEP. THERE WAS A CRACK LOCATED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DENT MEASURING APPROXIMATELY 1-INCH LONG. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LEAK COULD BE REPAIRED BY INSTALLATION OF A 2-FOOT BY 16-INCH TYPE B PRESSURIZED CONTAINING SLEEVE. INSTALLATION OF THE SLEEVE WAS COMPLETED ON JUNE 3. ALL WELDS WERE INSPECTED USING MAGNETIC PARTICLE AND ULTRASONIC THICKNESS METHODS. THE PIPELINE BETWEEN THE STOPPLE FITTINGS WAS PURGED, PRESSURE TESTED AND RETURNED TO NORMAL 405 PSIG SERVICE. THERE WAS NO FIRE, NO INJURIES AND NO LOSS OF SERVICE TO ANY CUSTOMERS. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE LEAK WAS A ROCK IMPINING ON THE LINE AND GROUND SUBSIDENCE. A FINAL REPORT WILL BE COMPLETED UPON DETERMINATION OF THE TOTAL COST OF REPAIRS.   SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT: IN THE NARRATIVE IT WAS INDICATED THAT THE LINE NUMBER WAS MNB69801, WHICH IS INCORRECT AND SHOULD INSTEAD BE MNB72701.  SUPPLEMENTAL/FINAL REPORT: TOTAL COST OF REPAIRS ESTIMATES, INCLUDING GAS LOSS HAVE BEEN UPDATED. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE LEAK WAS DETERMINED TO BE THAT GROUND SUBSIDENCE RESULTING IN A ROCK IMPINGING ON THE LINE, WHICH RESULTED IN DAMAGE TO COATING AND A DENT IN THE LINE AND AN APPROXIMATE ONE INCH CRACK IN THE BOTTOM OF THE DENT WHICH ALLOWED GAS LEAKAGE TO THE ATMOSPHERE.

PERSONNEL RESPONDED AND CONFIRMED THAT THE FIRE WAS COMING FROM THE GROUND ON WHAT WAS THE OWASA, IOWA 2-INCH BRANCH LINE (IAB47201) IN SECTION 20, TOWNSHIP 88N, RANGE 19W, HARDIN COUNTY, IOWA. THE OWASA BRANCH LINE IS APPROXIMATELY 0.932 MILES LONG AND ORIGINATES FROM A SIDE VALVE ON THE 6-INCH IOWA FALLS BRANCH LINE. THE POINT OF FIRE WAS LOCATED AT APPROXIMATE MILE POST .49. THE NRC, IUB AND PHMSA OFFICES WERE NOTIFIED. THE AREA OF THE LEAK AND FIRE HAD INCURRED HEAVY RAIN AND THUNDERSTORMS. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT A BOTTLE TRUCK WOULD BE PUT IN SERVICE AT THE OWASA TBS SO THAT THE LINE COULD BE TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE AND THE FIRE EXTINGUISHED. A CONTRACTOR WITH HEAVY EQUIPMENT AND MATS WAS OBTAINED TO ASSIST WITH REPAIRS. DIRT WAS BERMED TO ENABLE PUMPING OUT WATER TO ALLOW EXCAVATION OF THE SITE. UPON EXCAVATION OF THE SITE ALL INDICATIONS WERE THAT THE LEAK WAS CAUSED BY HIGH VOLTAGE ELECTRIC CURRENT DISCHARGE OFF THE PIPE WALL. THERE WAS DISBONDED COATING AT THE DISCHARGE POINT ON AN OTHERWISE WELL COATED LINE. THE PIPE WALL WAS SHINY AND HAD NOT EVEN FLASH RUSTED YET. THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF CORROSION OR PITTING AND NO CORROSION DEPOSITS OR SCALE. A SINGLE HOLE, APPROXIMATELY 3/8 INCH IN DIAMETER WAS LEAKING THE GAS. ALL INDICATIONS WERE THAT FEATURE CHARACTERISTICS WERE CONSISTENT WITH HIGH VOLTAGE DISCHARGE IN A RAPID EVENT. THE PIT CRATER WAS SMOOTH, NO DEPOSITS, ALMOST PERFECTLY SYMMETRICAL AND ALL METAL SURFACES APPEARED CLEAN AND SHINY. REPAIRS WERE MADE BY INSTALLING APPROXIMATELY 10 FEET OF NEW TESTED, COATED PIPE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE LIGHTNING STRUCK AT OR NEAR THE TBS OR TAKE OFF AS THE BLACK BOX FOR THE PHONE LINE WAS ALSO DAMAGED BY THE LIGHTNING STRIKE. THIS INCIDENT IS NOT EXPECTED TO REACH THE $50,000 THRESHOLD LEVEL FOR REPORTING, HOWEVER DUE TO THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A FIRE THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED. A FINAL REPORT WILL BE FILED WHEN ALL COST HAVE BEEN ACCUMULATED.    SUPPLEMENTAL/FINAL REPORT: A TOTAL COST OF REPAIRS,INCLUDING GAS LOSS, WAS CALCULATED AT $23,947. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE LEAK WAS DETERMINED TO BE CAUSED BY A LIGHTNING STRIKING NEAR OR AT THE TBS/TAKEOFF VALVE RESULTING IN A HIGH VOLTAGE ELECTRIC CURRENT DISCHARGE OFF THE PIPE WALL WHICH CAUSED AN APPROXIMATE 3/8 INCH DIAMETER HOLE IN THE LINE FROM WHICH GAS WAS LEAKING. REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED BY REPLACING APPROXIMATELY 10 FEET OF PIPE WITH NEW TWO-INCH, TESTED, COATED PIPE. THIS INCIDENT DID NOT EXCEED THE $50,000 REPORTING THRESHOLD BUT WAS REPORTED DO TO THE IGNITION OF LEAKING GAS.

PRESSURE ON THE LINE HAD BEEN CONSISTENTLY OPERATING IN THE 490 PSIG PRESSURE RANGE. THIS PIPELINE IS A DRESSER COUPLED PIPELINE. THE BEATRICE AREA HAD BEEN SUBJECT TO VERY HEAVY RAIN AND THUNDERSTORMS AND WARNINGS OF POTENTIAL FLASH FLOODING ON RIVERS AND  WATERWAYS. AN ALL-CALL WAS ISSUED TO THE BEATRICE REGION TEAMS. BASED ON  THE PRESSURE DROP STEPS WERE TAKEN TO IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFY TOWNS THAT COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED  AND THEY WERE SWITCHED OVER TO OTHER GAS SOURCE SERVICES. ONCE THIS WAS COMPLETED STEPS WERE TAKEN TO ISOLATE AN APPROXIMATE 13 MILES OF THIS LINE BY CLOSING BLOCK A  BLOCK VALVES ON THE LINE AT THE BEATRICE COMPRESSOR PLANT AND BLOCK VALVE # 6 ON THE MAINLINE. FIVE SMALL VOLUME CUSTOMERS WERE IDENTIFIED AND NOTIFIED. FOUR WERE DOMESTIC  USE FARM TAPS AND ONE WAS AN IRRIGATION SETTING. AS THERE WAS NO OUTSIDE NOTIFICATION OF A POTENTIAL DAMAGE SITE APPROPRIATE STEPS WERE TAKEN FOR TWO PEOPLE TEAMS TO VISUALLY CHECK THE 13 MILE SEGMENT OF PIPE FOR POTENTIAL SIGNS OF BLOWING GAS AND/OR DAMAGE.IT WAS FOUND THAT A JOINT OF PIPE APPROXIMATELY 25 FEET LONG, IN A WATERWAY, HAD BLOWN OUT OF THE GROUND. THIS SITE IS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 500 FEET NORTH OF MILEPOST 50.67 IN SECTION 32, TOWNSHIP 3N, RANGE 6E, ALL IN GAGE COUNTY NEBRASKA. THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AND PHMSA CENTRAL REGION WAS NOTIFIED. THERE WAS NO FIRE, NO INJURIES AND NO LOSS OF SERVICE TO ANY TOWNS. NORTHERN IS CURRENTLY TAKING APPROPRIATE ACTIONS TO MAKE REPAIRS TO THE LINE. THIS EVENT WAS REPORTED TO THE NRC AND PHMSA AND A 7100 REPORT IS BEING FILED AS THE COST OF THE FAILURE, INCLUDING GAS LOSS WILL EXCEED THE $50,000 REPORTING THRESHOLD LEVEL. A FINAL CAUSE FOR THE FAILURE IS UNDER INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER IT IS CURRENT BELIEVED THAT THE HEAVY RAINS AND FLOODING OF THE  WATERWAY RESULTED IN EROSION OF SUPPORTING DIRT AROUND THE PIPELINES DRESSER COUPLING WHICH RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL FORCE OF WATER FLOW ON THE DRESSER COUPLINGS WHICH   ULTIMATELY LEAD TO THE FAILURE OF A DRESSER COUPLING. APPROPRIATE SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION SUCH AS TOTAL COST OF REPAIRS AND MATERIALS REQUIRED TO EFFECT REPAIRS WILL  BE REPORTED.  SUPPLEMENTAL/FINAL REPORT: AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE DETERMINED THAT THE CAUSE WAS HEAVY LOCALIZED RAIN FALL WASH OUT THE DIRT ON THE BANKS AROUND DRESSER COUPLING WHICH ALLOWED THE WATER FORCE TO SEPARATE THE PIPE FROM A DRESSER COUPLING. APPROXIMATELY 269 FEET OF NEW 24 INCH TESTED PIPE WAS INSTALLED TO COMPLETE THE REPAIR PROCESS. AN UPDATED ESTIMATE OF TOTAL COST HAS BEEN ENTERED ON THIS FINAL REPORT. THIS EVENT IS CONSIDERED COMPLETE AND CLOSED WITH NO FURTHER ACTIONS PENDING OR PLANNED.  09/18/2012 ADDED INCIDENT COORDINATES AS PER REQUST OF JIM BUNN, PHMSA."

DURING THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE COMPRESSOR STATION PAD, DURRETT CONSTRUCTION PILED DEBRIS (TREES, LIMBS, ETC) ON THE S ELM GROVE 12 ROW.     TODD WOODWARD CONTACTED PETROHAWK 3 TIMES DURING THE WEEK PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT (ED LARY ON 10/30/08, LANE JOHNSON ON 10/31/08 AND JEFF MOODY ON 11/4/08) AND REQUESTED TO HAVE THIS DEBRIS REMOVED FROM OUR ROW.

HE WAS USING A TRACKHOE, WORKING ALONE AND DID NOT HAVE A SPOTTER OR SUPERVISOR. BY THIS TIME, THE MAJORITY OF THE YELLOW PIN FLAGS AND ROW STAKES HAD BEEN DISTURBED AND WERE NO LONGER VISIBLE ON THE PIPELINE OR ROW IN THE IMMEDIATE DIGGING AREA DUE TO THE CLEARING AND PILING OF DEBRIS ON THE ROW.  REGENCYS PIPELINE MARKER AT THE ROAD (100 FEET FROM INCIDENT) WAS KNOCKED DOWN AND PARTIALLY COVERED IN DIRT. RABO WAS AWARE THAT THERE WAS A PIPELINE NEAR THE LOCATION. THE ONLY PIPELINE MARKERS THAT WERE STILL VISIBLE WERE YELLOW PIN FLAGS ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE LOCATION AND A ROW STAKE ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE LOCATION. HE ASSUMED THAT THE PIPELINE WAS IN A STRAIGHT LINE BETWEEN THESE MARKERS. THIS WOULD HAVE PLACED THE PIPELINE ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE DEBRIS PILE. IN REALITY, THE PIPELINE CURVED BETWEEN THESE MARKERS. RABO DUG A HOLE AND BURIED SOME DEBRIS TO THE WEST OF THE PIPELINE. HE THEN MOVED EAST OF HIS ORIGINAL HOLE AND BEGAN TO DIG. AT THIS POINT, HE WAS DIGGING DIRECTLY OVER THE S ELM GROVE 12 PIPELINE. AT 8:52 AM RABO HIT THE PIPELINE WITH THE TRACKHOE BUCKET AND RUPTURED THE PIPELINE. HE IMMEDIATELY JUMPED FROM THE TRACKHOE AND RAN EAST (LEAVING THE TRACKHOE RUNNING). THE BUCKET ON THE TRACKHOE DEFLECTED THE GAS AWAY FROM THE TRACKHOE. RABO WAS NOT INJURED.

NOTIFICATION WAS MADE TO THE NRC (TICKET # 897807 DTD 2/18/09). ADDITIONAL NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO THE COAST GUARD, MMS AND SW OPNS OF PHMSA. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LEAK WAS ON NORTHERN'S 24-INCH PIPELINE (TOS80631). ACTIONS WERE TAKEN TO SHUT IN THE LINE AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL PLATFORMS WERE ISOLATED FROM THE LINE. PRELIMINARY INDICATIONS ARE THAT A MECHANICAL COUPLING ON A 24 INCH BYPASS PIPING, THAT WAS INSTALLED PRIOR TO REMOVAL OF PLATFORM 686, HAD SEPARATED FROM THE PIPELINE. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE EVENT IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. PLANS ARE CURRENTLY UNDERWAY TO EVALUATE NECESSARY REPAIRS AND DEVELOP A REPAIR PLAN. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED AS THE COST OF REPAIRS AND GAS LOSS ARE DEFINATELY GOING TO EXCEED THE $50,000 REPORTING THRESHOLD LEVEL. THERE WAS NO FIRE, NO INJURIES, NO EXPLOSIONS AND NO EVACATIONS EXPERIENCED DURING THIS EVENT. ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL/FINAL REPORTS WILL BE FILED UPON COMPLETION OF THE INVESTIGATION AND FINAL COST OF REPAIRS IS DETERMINED.    SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT - APRIL 27, 2009: A REPAIR PLAN HAS BEEN SUBMITTED AND APPROVED BY THE MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE (MMS). BIDS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED FROM CONTRACTORS TO COMPLETE THE REPAIRS AND ARE CURRENTLY BEING EVALUATED. TO DATE IT HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED WHAT WAS THE ROOT CAUSE. THE INTENT, DURING THE REPAIR PROCESS, IS TO BRING BACK TO SHORE ALL MATERIALS OF THE BYPASS PIPING AND TO CONDUCT A FAILURE ANALYSIS. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THIS WILL BE COMPLETED SOME TIME IN JUNE 2009, CONTINGENT UPON CONTRACTOR, MATERIALS AND WEATHER CONDITIONS. A FINAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED UPON PROJECT AND FAILURE ANALYSIS COMPLETION.  SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT: THE TOTAL ESTIMATED COST FOR GAS LOSS AND OPERATOR DAMAGE HAS BEEN UPDATED. COMPLETION OF THIS REPAIR WAS INCLUDED WITH TWO OTHER MMS APPROVED PROJECTS. AVAILABILITY OF CONTRACTORS, MATERIALS AND WEATHER CONDITIONS HAVE HAMPERED EXPEDITED COMPLETION OF REPAIRS. CURRENTLY PIPING IS BEING DE-WATERED AND BARRING ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIS PROJECT WILL BE COMPELTED BY SEPTEMBER 1ST. THE PIPING WITH THE FAILED MECHANICAL COUPLING HAS BEEN RETREIVED AND IS BEING ANALYZED BY AN OUTSIDE LABORATORY TO ASSIST WITH DETERMINING THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE EVENT. A FINAL REPORT ON THIS EVENT WILL BE FILED UPON COMPLETION OF PROJECT AND CONCURRENCE ON THE ROOT CAUSE.    FINAL REPORT: REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED AS OUTLINE IN A REPAIR PLAN THAT WAS SUBMITTED AND APPROVED BY THE MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICES (MMS). THE LINE WAS RETURNED TO SERVICE EFFECTIVE AUGUST 13, 2009. A FAILURE ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED BY STORK TESTING & METALLURGICAL CONSULTING, INC. AFTER EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS AND TESTING IT APPEARS THAT THE FAILURE IS LIKELY TO BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO A COMBINATION OF FACTORS WHICH ARE AN INCOMPLETE ENGAGEMENT BY THE SLIP ANCHOR AROUND ITS CIRCUMFERENCE ON THE MECHNAICAL COUPLING, PIPE OVALITY AND IT'S STRENGHT. ALL BYPASS PIPING, THE FAILED COUPLING AND ANOTHER MECHANICAL COUPLING WERE REMOVED AND REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED BY INSTALLATION OF APPROXIMATELY 133 FEET OF NEW 24-INCH, PREFABRICATED, WELDS RADIOGRAPHED, COATED PIPING, WHICH WAS HYDRO TESTED ON SHORE TO A PRESSURE BETWEEN 2,150 AND 2,300 PSIG, WHICH IS 1.5 TO 1.6 OF MAOP WITH WATER PRIOR TO INSTALLATION/COMPLETION OF REPAIRS.

THE FAILURE OCCURRED AT A LOW POINT IN THE UNPIGGABLE PIPELINE. THE PIPE WAS INSTALLED IN 1948 AND HAS AN IMPRESSED CURRENT CATHODIC PROTECTION (CP) SYSTEM THAT WAS ENERGIZED IN 1961.    A TEN-FOOT SECTION OF PIPE THAT INCLUDED THE RUPTURED JOINT AND A PORTION OF THE ADJACENT UPSTREAM JOINT WAS SHIPPED TO DNV FOR ANALYSIS. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE FAILURE ANALYSIS WERE TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE AND IDENTIFY ANY CONTRIBUTING FACTORS.    THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS:     THE RUPTURE OCCURRED AT A GROOVE LOCATED AT THE          LONGITUDINAL SEAM WELD.   INTERNAL CORROSION WAS PRESENT IN THE VICINITY OF THE GROOVE.   THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE GROOVE AND ASSOCIATED CORROSION ATTACK IS CONSISTENT WITH SELECTIVE SEAM CORROSION ASSOCIATED WITH ELECTRIC RESISTANCE WELD (ERW) SEAMS.   THE WELD MICROSTRUCTURE IS CONSISTENT WITH AN ELECTRIC RESISTANCE WELD (ERW) SEAM.   THE RESULTS OF THE CHEMICAL ANALYSIS ARE CONSISTENT WITH COMPOSITION SPECIFICATIONS FOR API 5L GRADES B AND C LINE PIPE STEEL IN PLACE AT THE TIME OF MANUFACTURE.   THE RESULTS OF THE MECHANICAL ANALYSIS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE SPECIFICATIONS FOR API 5L GRADES B AND C LINE PIPE THAT WERE IN PLACE AT THE TIME OF MANUFACTURE.   THE CHARPY V-NOTCH RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE BASE METAL AND WELD METAL EXHIBITED LOW TOUGHNESS VALUES, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE VINTAGE AND GRADE OF PIPE.    THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS INDICATE THAT THE FAILURE OCCURRED DUE TO INTERNAL SELECTIVE SEAM CORROSION. THE SYNERGISTIC EFFECT OF THE SELECTIVE SEAM CORROSION, THE ORIENTATION OF THE SEAM WELD (5:30 OCLOCK ORIENTATION), AND THE LOW TOUGHNESS OF THE BASE AND WELD METALS WERE THREE OF THE MAIN CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE FAILURE.

THE PIPELINE WAS MARKED AT BOTH SIDES OF THE PROPERTY WITH PIPELINE MARKERS AND AN ADDITIONAL MARKER WAS VISIBLE APPROXIMATELY 121 FT WEST OF THE LINE HIT LOCATION, IN A TREE ROW. AN IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT IS IN-PROGESS AND ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL/FINAL REPORTS WILL BE FILED AS THE ROOT CAUSE & TOTAL COST OF REPAIRS INFORMATION IS COMPLETE. THERE WAS NO LOSS OF SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS. SUPPLEMENTAL/FINAL REPORT: AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NO ""ONE CALL"" MADE TO DIGGERS HOTLINE INCORPORATED (WISCONSIN) PRIOR TO MOVING SOIL AND EXCAVATION ACTIVITIES AT THE SITE, WHICH RESULTED IN REMOVAL OF SOIL FROM OVER THE PIPELINE TO THE EXTENT THAT THE PIPELINE WAS STRUCK AND SEVERED.  SUPPLEMENTAL UPDATE OF FINAL REPORT:  CORRECTED ESTIMATED COSTS FROM $287120 TO $316630 (GAS LOSS $87375; OPERATOR DAMAGE $229,255). NO OTHER MODIFICATION OR CORRECTIONS MADE.  09/18/2012 ADDED INCIDENT COORDINATES AS PER REQUEST OF JIM BUNN, PHMSA."

REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED AROUND APRIL 27, 2009 BY INSTALLING A WELD TEE. THE RESULTS FROM INVESTIGATION CONFIRM THAT THE BRANCH-TO-CARRIER PIPE FILLET WELD UNDER THE FULL ENCIRCLEMENT SADDLE CONTAINED A CRACK EXTENDING THROUGH THE WELD CAP AND STOPPING JUST BEFORE THE ROOT BEAD LEAVING A SMALL LIGAMENT OF METAL PREVENTING THROUGH-WALL PENETRATION. BASED ON THE LAB RESULTS, THE CRACK APPEARED TO HAVE PROPAGATED RAPIDLY MANY YEARS AGO AND THEN REMAINED STABLE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME THEREAFTER. MINOR STRESS APPEARS TO HAVE CAUSED A DUCTILE FAILURE IN THE REMAINING METAL LIGAMENT BETWEEN THE OLD EXISTING CRACK AND THE INADEQUATELY FUSED ROOT BEAD WHICH RESULTED IN THE GAS LEAK."

CDT, NORTHERN'S OPERATION COMMUNICATION CENTER, IN OMAHA, NE RECEIVED AN EMERGENCY CALL REPORTING THAT THERE WAS GAS BLOWING TO ATMOSPHERE AND A POSSIBLE RUPTURE OF THE PIPELINE APPROXIMATELY 1 1/4 MILES NORTH OF THE TOWN OF BESSMER, MICHIGAN. PERSONNEL WERE IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED TO THE AREA AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT A PIPE RUPTURE HAD OCCURRED ON THE M432B (MIM10101) 16-INCH CARLTON-WAKEFIELD B LINE @ APPROXIMATE MILEPOST 121.26. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT EVACUATED APPROXIMATELY 15 HOME SITES AND ESTABLISHED A 1/2 MILE SAFE ZONE. THE INCIDENT OCCURRED IN THE SE1/4 OF SECTION 3, T47N, R46W IN GOGEBIC COUNTY, MICHIGAN. LINE PRESSURE AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT WAS APPROXIMATELY 923 PSIG. THE EVENT WAS IMMEDIATELY REPORTED TO THE NRC (TICKET # 909472), PHMSA, MICHIGAN PUBLIC SAFETY, EPA AND LOCAL AND STATE AGENCIES. INITIAL INVESTIGATION INDICATED THAT APPROXIMATELY 66 FEET OF PIPE HAD BLOWN OUT OF THE GROUND. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS WERE TAKEN TO ISOLATE THE SEGMENT OF LINE AND ATTEMPT TO MAINTAIN AS MUCH SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS AS POSSIBLE. NORTHERN'S BOTTLE TRUCKS WERE BROUGHT IN AND PLACED IN SERVICE FOR THE TOWN OF BESSEMER AND RAMSAY. GAS SERVICE TO APPROXIMATELY 380 HOMES IN RAMSAY WAS LOST AND HAD TO BE RESTORED BY XCEL ENERGY. SERVICE TO INTERRUPTIBLE BUSINESSES IN BESSEMER WAS INTERRUPTED. THE PIPE IN THE FAILED SEGMENT WAS MANUFACTURED BY YOUNGSTOWN AND INSTALLED IN 1965. IT IS 16-INCH X 0.203 AND 0.250 INCH WALL THICKNESS, GRADE X-60 ELECTRIC RESISTANCE WELDED (ERW) PIPE.  REPAIRS WERE MADE BY INSTALLING APPROPRIATE STOPPLE FITTINGS TO ENABLE REPLACEMENT OF APPROXIMATELY 219 FEET OF NEW 16-INCH TESTED, X-60, 0.312 WALL THICKNESS PIPE. THE NEW PIPE WAS PRESSURE TESTED TO A MINIMUM TEST PRESSURE OF 1620 PSIG. A RETURN TO SERVICE PLAN WAS DEVELOPED AND SUBMITTED TO THE CENTRAL REGION OFFICE OF PHMSA FOR REVIEW. PHMSA DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY CONCERNS WITH THE PLAN THEREFORE NORTHERN WAS AUTHORIZED TO RE-START THE CARLTON TO MARQUETTE LINE AT A REDUCED PRESSURE AS REQUIRED BY A CORRECTIVE ACTION ORDER ISSUED BY THE ASSOCIATE ADMINISTRATOR FOR PIPELINE SAFETY. THE CORRECTIVE ACTION ORDER REQUIRES THAT THE PRESSURE AT THE FAILURE SITE AND DOWNSTREAM OF THE FAILURE SITE IS NOT TO EXCEED 80% OF THE OPERATING PRESSURE IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE FAILURE. SPECIFICALLY, THE PRESSURE AT THE FAILURE SITE IS NOT TO EXCEED 739 PSIG. THIS PRESSURE RESTRICTION WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL WRITTEN APPROVAL TO INCREASE THE PRESSURE OR RETURN THE PIPELINE TO ITS PRE-FAILURE OPERATING PRESSURE IS OBTAINED FROM THE REGIONAL DIRECTOR, PHMSA. PIECES OF THE FAILED PIPE HAVE BEEN SENT TO BRYAN LAB IN HOUSTON, TX FOR FAILURE ANALYSIS. AN ADDITIONAL SECTION OF PIPE WERE SENT TO KEIFNER & ASSOCIATES LABORATORY IN OHIO. KEIFNER AND BRYAN LABS WILL ASSIST NORTHERN WITH IDENTIFYING THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE AND THE INSPECTION TECHNIQUES NORTHERN WILL USE TO IDENTIFY OTHER RISKS TO THE PIPELINE SYSTEM. ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTS WILL BE FILED AS THE ROOT CAUSE AND FINAL, ACCURATE COST OF GAS LOSS/REPAIRS ARE DETERMINED.  SUPPLEMENTAL/FINAL REPORT: THIS REPORT IS BEING SUBMITTED TO UPDATE THE COTS INCURRED IN THE REPAIR PROCESS OF THIS INCIDENT. IN ADDITION, THE ROOT CAUSE HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS STRESS CORROSION CRACKING (SCC). A CORRECTIVE ACTION ORDER (CAO) WAS ISSUED BY PHMSA, RE; CPF NO.3-2009-1010H. ADDITIONAL ACTIONS AND COST ARE BEING INCURRED TO COMPLY WITH THE CAO, AND MUST BE COMPLETED PRIOR TO RESTORATION OF THE LINE PRESSURE BACK TO IT'S CAPABILITY PRIOR TO THE RUPTURE. THESE ACTIONS AND COST ARE BEING ADDRESSED VIA QUARTERLY REPORTS TO THE DIRECTOR, CENTRAL REGION OF OPS. AS FAR AS COST AND REPAIR ACTIONS TAKEN TO ADDRESS THE RUPTURE EVENT, PER THIS 7100 REPORT, THERE ARE CONSIDERED COMPLETE.  SUPPLEMENTAL/FINAL REPORT: DO TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF ADDITONAL COST, FROM EMPLOYEE EXPENSE AND OUTSIDE SERVICES, THIS SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT IS BEING SUBMITTED TO CORRECT THE PREVIOUS TOTAL COST OF $674,379 TO $692, 449.   09/18/2012 ADDED INCIDENT COORDINATES AS PER REQUEST OF JIM BUNN, PHMSA."

FURTHER INVESTIGATION ON OCTOBER 7, 2009 REVEALED THAT THAT LEAK WAS ESSENTIALLY ELIMINATED BY CLOSING THE VALVE AND VENTING THE VALVE BODY CAVITY. AFTER FORMULATING A RESPONSE PLAN, MICHCON REDUCED THE OPERATING PRESSURE OF THE 24"" PIPELINE FROM APPROXIMATELY 675 PSIG TO 180 PSIG BY BLOCKING IN THE PIPELINE SEGMENT FROM THE EAST AND UTILIZING SUCTION FROM A COMPRESSOR STATION SEVERAL MILES TO THE WEST. THE PRESSURE WAS STABILIZED AT 16:00 ON OCTOBER 9, 2009. MICHCON MADE AN EXCAVATION AT THE VALVE SITE, INTENDING TO REPAIR WHAT WAS BELIEVED TO BE A LEAKING VALVE BODY BLEED FITTING. ONCE THE BURIED VALVE WAS EXPOSED, NATURAL GAS WAS FOUND TO BE LEAKING NOT FROM A BODY BLEED BUT FROM THE UPPER BONNET AND BEARING HOUSING, INDICATING A POSSIBLE BODY SEAL FAILURE. MICHCON TECHNICIANS ATTEMPTED TO STOP THE LEAK BY TIGHTENING THE SEAL PACKING, BUT THIS EFFORT WAS INEFFECTIVE.

PLANNING TO EXCAVATE AND INSPECT THIS ANOMALY, FIELD PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED ON OCTOBER 28, 2009, TO CONDUCT A LEAK SURVEY AT THE SITE.  THE SURVEY INDICATED THAT THERE WAS LEAKING GAS.  AFTER SHUTTING IN THE VALVE SECTION, PIPELINE PRESSURE WAS LOWERED FROM 732 PSIG TO APPROXIMATELY 200 PSIG.  THE FOLLOWING DAY, PRESSURE WAS LOWERED TO ATMOSPHERIC AND THE SITE WAS EXCAVATED.  THE ANOMALY WAS INSPECTED AND WAS DETERMINED TO BE A PIN-HOLE-SIZED LEAK WITHIN AN APPROXIMATE ONE-INCH DIAMETER PIT.  ON EXAMINATION, THE PIT APPEARED TO HAVE CHARACTERISTICS CONSISTENT WITH THE THOSE CAUSED AS A RESULT OF A LIGHTNING STRIKE.  THE PIPE SEGMENT CONTAINING THE ANOMALY WAS REMOVED AND REPLACED.  FURTHER METALURGICAL ANALYSIS CONCLUDED THAT CAUSE OF THE LEAK WAS A LIGHTNING STRIKE THAT CREATED A METAL LOSS AREA ON THE OUTSIDE SURFACE APPROXIMATELY 1-INCH IN DIAMETR WITH A THROUGH-WALL PINHOLE LEAK AT THE DEEPEST PORTION OF THE MELTED AREA."

THE NATUAL GAS PIPELINE RUPTURE RESULTED IN A FIRE. A HOME NEAR THE RUPTURE SITE WAS DESTROYED BY FIRE AND THREE INDIVIDUALS RESIDING IN THE HOME WERE INJURED AND HOSPITALIZED. OTHER NEARBY STRUCTURES SUFFERED PROPERTY DAMAGE. FINDINGS IN THE METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS REPORT OF THE RUPTURED 24"" LINE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:  -THE ORIGIN OF THE RUPTURE WAS NEAR THE SADDLE AREA OF THE ABANDONED BRANCH CONNECTION TAP. FRACTURE ORIGINATED IN THE CARRIER PIPE AT THE APPROXIMATE 7:30 POSITION ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE TAP.  -BENDING STRESSES ON THE ABANDONED BRANCH CONNECTION TAP PLACED TENSILE STRESSES ACROSS THE THICKNESS OF THE CARRIER PIPE.  -THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF PROGRESSIVE CRACK GROWTH, SUCH AS ENVIRONMENTAL CRACKING OR FATIGUE IN THE FRACTURE.  -THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A LEAK PRESENT IN THE PIPE PRIOR TO THE OVERLOAD EVENT THAT CAUSED THE RUPTURE.  -CORROSION DAMAGE WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE RUPTURE OF THE PIPE.  -NO DEFECTS WERE OBSERVED IN THE SADDLE TO CARRIER PIPE WELD THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE RUPTURE OF THE PIPE.    THE FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS OF THE PIPELINE RUPTURE WAS INCONCLUSIVE IN DETERMINING THE CAUSE OF FAILURE.    HOWEVER, THE ANALYSIS WORK ALLOWS FOR THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS TO BE REACHED:   X PRESENCE OF LAMINATIONS IN THE CARRIER PIPE MID-WALL WAS NOT A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR.  X WEIGHT OF THE ABANDONED STUB AND SOIL ON TOP OF IT WERE INSUFFICIENT TO CAUSE THE FAILURE.  X LACK OF SUPPORT UNDER THE ABANDONED STUB WAS NOT A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR.  X THE SADDLE BEING OF A DIFFERENT SIZE (6-INCH X 20-INCH) WAS NOT A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR.  X SOIL EXPANSION UNDERNEATH THE BRANCH PIPE WAS NOT A CAUSATIVE FACTOR.  X ABNORMAL GAS OR AMBIENT TEMPERATURE CONDITIONS WERE NOT CONTRIBUTING FACTORS."
